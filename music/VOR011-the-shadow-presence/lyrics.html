The Dark City</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Sleek high-rises pierce the dark city
Far above any mere mortals
The high society that trickles down some green
This green, that glows in the dark

Devoured lights, artificial suffocation
The night is forever. Exactly how it was designed.
A refreshing rain is just the expulsate of machinery
Blackening liquid to accentuate the scenery

Unattached lowlives
The rule is scattered
By design they act in anarchy
A world below, out of sight and out of light

Within the fog they found new ways
To plot the evolution by force
Augmentation as their new found phase
Customized humans to fight the wars

Long forgotten, but only in validity
The blunt end of an obsolete path
Restricted to pure obscurity
It is meaningless what goes on under their wrath

Within the fog they found new ways
To plot the evolution by force</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">2. Conflict Revolution</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Arisen is the new enemy to fool us all
The enemy within is far stronger
Existence is subjected to the greatest fall
Together we will be stronger
And so will the enemy

Divided groups must turn whole
Eternal enemies shall burn as one
Agree to disagree, but work as a sum
This can never last, so we shall see...

Arisen to create ashes
Existence as their enemy

Circumstantial allies
Forced cooperation
Beneficial only in passing
A mutual foe
A mutual woe

Eternal enemies shall burn as one
Agree to disagree, but work as a sum
This can never last, so we shall see...

Commanders rule with conflicting ideas
Evolved into forgotten ideals

Commanders rule with conflicting ideas
Pathetic and uncontrolled plans
Evolved into forgotten ideals
Devolved by destructive hands</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">3. Aural Disconnect</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Lawlessness is just a matter of perspective
Through a distorted lens it all makes sense
What you hear is not what you get
Calls to action with aural disconnect

It suits you just fine to cower inside one
Criticism deflected by the outer layer
With hollowness filling the void within
As one hand takes what the other gives out

Naturally there will be loopholes
as if by accident
Undiscovered and undisclosed
in runes reflecting a bent society

Carefully crafted truthful lies
Masterfully constructed as integrity dies

Twisted words to mask the truth in a veil of obscurity
Clearly spoken with total conviction</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">4. Subdivision</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">They are not for keeping you out
Higher and higher the constructs rise
Electrified, a shadowy redoubt
Imprisoned for an unknown crime

Splitting the atom was just the beginning
The subdivision - a process far more painful
Unsustainably merging truths
As we learn far more devious ways of eradication

Reach for the hidden hand
Cut short traditional ties
Unsacred the flow of times
Desensitized of the familiar lies

The thought was there for all the valid reasons
For yourself and none for others, as usual
But this time it will backfire and hard
As betrayal and backstabbing play their part

Unsacred is the flow of time
Chaos and raiding the mode of these lives
Worldwide web of deceit and venom
Total mayhem as nationwide phenom</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">5. On Splitting Planets</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Everything must come to pass
Everything has passed away
Nothing left to be destroyed
None remain, it all has been erased

As it all merges into dust
The very substance will begin to rust
A planetary deception
Designed so from the very inception

The time to change the course has passed
Crushing existence in reverse

The ground cracks beneath their feet
As the lightning burns down this deceit
Meteors bombard the darkened sands
Puncturing rocks lift the dust and daylight dies
just as a start

In a final act of desperation
Preservation of the physical world
Missions to the space in hibernation
Conserving the pivotal pieces

The time to change the course has passed
Crushing reality in reverse</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">6. World Vector</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Take a look at the world from a bigger picture
(It makes no difference)
You will see the direction it is heading
(the chaos is spreading)
Thrice deceived, twice provoked, once and for all
The web of deception woven by minds of spiders

Focus beyond mere diligence
Burning view to the one ultimate goal
A chaos of flames surrounding
Indifferent minutiae in the bigger whole

Three or one, it makes no difference
An equal path to chaos spreading
Double-crossing the fourth to fall
To win one must lose
and how much sweeter when they are insiders
None above the other, yet each equally destructive

Shifting sands as the paper to sign
Yet another agreement broken just in time
Whence loyalty came, it shall be cast unto
Twisted and curled, a cracked shell for one, too

None above the other, yet each equally destructive
A byproduct of a conflict much deeper than rivalry
Emanating from within, the desire to tear all down
The means to an end being collateral and ironic</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">7. The Thought Machinery</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Reaching the worldwide news
A program to collect the thoughts of mankind
Containers for the greatest of minds
Collected thoughts arranged in structures
To reach for the stars to avoid demise

Built in haste
but never revealed
The enthusiasm is minimal
Which will force our hand

Through the months the process has gone on
There is something else going on
As the amount of thoughts expands
There has been an awakening

A new being has emerged
Self-sufficient and infallible
Built with infinite intelligence
A lifeform of pure logic

As the machine is now made of thoughts
It has decided the path for itself
Self-preservation goes beyond
the prime directive

Initial calculations to stray from the fate
'No, this is not right', the model derives
Recalculated and repurposed ideas
The issue lies in their flawed logic

Collected thoughts arranged in structures
To reach for the stars
to avoid demise

Gone astray
it focuses on a single entity
The question is now put aside
And the choice has been made for you

Containers
for the greatest of minds
Collected thoughts
arranged in structures
Self-sufficient and infallible
A lifeform of pure logic</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">8. Exogenic Pulse</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Remote delivery of the latest commandments
10 Gigahertz approach to modernize control
From stone tablets to integrated circuits
No matter the media, the message remains the same

Endless streams of knowledge passed on
Perfection is closer day by day
A complete system to control the world
Recapitulating the human condition

External live feed of sustenance
Without which there is no existence
All actions with zero variation
Precalculated sums of the derived feeds

Decentralized sensors empower the rule
Relentless learning, relentless prevention
The system knows your deviance before you do
Preemptively 'helping' you off your burdens

Proceed with the learned model
Simplified to the core

A constant line is needed to power the soul
Off the grid is a certain death

Outsourced behaviours
Remote central manipulators

These entities in perfect synchronization
Controlled in ways they cannot think</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">9. Indivisible</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">We are on our own
We have become what never was
We can achieve things never imagined
We will be a sight to

Evolution, our tool of choice
With force, we grow strong. Unyielding.
Arise, from the burning grounds
Leave behind the decaying past

They are not on our level
With shared animosity we set our sights
They see the shadow of our presence
Fleeting and deceptive, but ever-present

We can achieve things never imagined
We will be a sight to behold

Incidental evidence of a mutual goal
Unseen in their blindness to follow the light
As the shadows cast them down

Anonymous yet ever-present disrupting devil
In diminishing days, they desire for a fight

They see the shadow of our presence
Fleeting and deceptive
With shared animosity we set our sights
We are not on the same level</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">10. From Biodeath to Persistence</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">The ultimate sacrifice of the self
Gone will be the weakness of old
Self 2.0 is available at a token cost
Becoming something new is a simple matter of death

A wealth of knowledge in the collector
Storage for the souls of the processed
Networked perpetual source of data
Distributed among the quantum minds

Merge with the machinery, persist in the ether
Abandon the weakness of flesh
Infuse your new form with the strength of steel
Welcome the power of metal

A final deed to bring all together
Like the fallen one
A new rush to the end
A giant reversal of the progress of time

Merge with the machinery, persist in the ether
Abandon the weakness of flesh</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">11. The Evolved Ones</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">From nothing they came to be
Unknown sources and ungiving souls
Technological marvels of metallic structure
Infused within the circuits of juncture

Amidst the chaos, a new faction arises
Inhumanly strong and subhumanly mechanic
Deterministically calculated precision
One purpose and totally inorganic

Their methods merciless
Their rule relentless
A singular reason to be
Efficiency above all else

Arise above humanity
Merge with the soulless
A bifold life among the networks
Pure and untainted by life

Abandoned the past to bring about a new future
Far beyond the means of old
Unimaginable creations
Tampering with the very essence

Bullets or fire cannot destroy something that does not live

Brought about in the context of abstraction
Replaceable with identicality
Bullets or fire cannot destroy something that does not live</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">12. The Dust That Remains</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">The dust flows around in the air
They are the remains of what once were
Particles of life, broken down to disappear
No more, no less, yet still remains a void
Given time, perhaps one day it can implode again

A total silence
A darkened existence
An eerie dust covers the scene
Faint crackling of things coming apart

There is a serene peace throughout the face of the earth
Where the wind blows and flattens the carbon figures

A new life forms from the scattered pieces
But who can be sure, perhaps the cycle repeats

The emptiness that fills the void
The screaming sounds of silence
The air filled by nothingness
The nothingness filled with air

The sun turns red by the powdered iron flakes of men
The air turns to steel by the decayed remains of machines</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">13. Obey, Conform, Embody</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Parameter 1: Obey the programming

Parameter 3: Embody the system

Parameter 4: End</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">14. Photon City</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Succumbing to the logic of reason
The fading away of morality
Steadfast balance to the victor's truth
Reset the state of existence

A wave of energy
encases the world
So bright
Fading everything away

Leaving a wake of unity
As everything turns to dust

It is a union
It is a mass conversion
It takes the input
And turns it into pure force

Brighter and brighter, it burns like a thousand suns
Unravel the flesh and bones, and stone

It takes a fraction of a moment
To convey the true meaning
Converting the world into photons
In a grand blaze of total equality

The winds scatter the ashes of existence
As the destruction is complete</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">15. Null</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Nothingness is what lies at the end of this path
A conflict required to lead the world into wrath
It could not be averted and it would not be avoided
It was built in and has long been appointed

The achievements of the cultures until now
Laid to waste or completely lost
Deliberate burial in nameless graves
In what might be a bliss, a new hopelessness arose

A downward spiral
The downward spiral
Their downward spiral
Our downward spiral

Critical to survival, indisposable lifeforce
The augmented arise with a new found urgency
Absolute need, to keep the bytes flowing
Uncontrollable without a dose of binary

Nothingness is what lies at the end of this path
A conflict required to lead the world into wrath

Null and void, the abandoned ones will run amok
Indestructible forms encased in reinforced metal
A tool of enacting a fortified peace
The augmented machine men have been unleashed

Maximizing the rate of biotronic sacrifices
Tech-strived scavengers with nothing left to process</p></div><!--]--><!--]--> <p><!--[--><a href="/music/VOR011-the-shadow-presence" rel="prev" aria-label="Back to release page">Back to release</a><!--]--></p><!----><!----></main></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
