The Final 200</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">In a world of chaos, where shadows reign

The darkness of humanity
lost in a corrosive sea of confusion 
The embers of our worth
Scourge of the wasteland

Every battle fought, a life sacrificed
The final 200, against the endless night

Reduced to paragraphs
in the books of other species

A long forgotten world
discovered from beneath the sands
Documented in ashes and rust

Through blood-soaked fields, they press on
Scars etched on their souls
They fight for the future
for their lives, for what remains.
A dwindling flame, never to fade
 
Amidst the ruins
broken relics reveal the strife
Defiance - their legacy, fueled by fire

The weapons clash against the endless night
The silence in the moment when hope refused to die

The heartbeat of the machine
The last two hundred souls

The darkness of humanity
Revel in the corrosive sea of confusion 
The embers of our worth
Scourge of the wasteland

They march into battle
undeterred and unswayed
A barren world opens up
in a sickening glow</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">2. Sinews</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Beneath the surface, a pulsating drive
A fusion of flesh and circuitry
From the depths of creation, it is born
Sinews and wires, forever fused 

Whispers of electricity coursing through the veins
In the realm of gears
this is the only sound that remains

Augmentative replacement
Dissociative neural pathways
The feedback of the system 
has been shut down 
through errors and bias

In this vessel, a soul remains
A symphony where flesh finds its place

As the gears keep on turning
the world spins along
Embracing the darkness
harnessing all its might

Unveiling the power 
that we strive to behold
In the depths of the machinery
secrets lie untold

Invalid output, a chaos innate
How to study a rewritten past
Control mechanism
A structured bias 

As we march through the chaos
our purpose takes point
In the abyss we wander
harnessing all its essence

Unveiling the power 
that we strive to behold
In the shadows we find strength
so let the gears keep turning</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">3. Alien DNA</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">In shadows deep
a secret lies concealed

We are the chosen, the hybrids reborn
Embracing our essence, no longer forlorn
With newfound knowledge, we rise above
Harnessing the alien, the power we've become

A metamorphosis, an evolution unfolds
Harbingers of change, the heralds of new
Once blind to truth, we walked in ignorance
But now enlightened, we claim our inheritance

Unleashing gifts, long dormant inside 
(But now enlightened, we claim our inheritance)

No longer confined by human bounds
We transcend limitations, find new horizons
A union of worlds
Of alien souls

The children of cosmos
our destiny entwined
In the hidden depths of minds
a legacy from stars

So let us embrace this cosmic connection
Our alien heritage
Our shared direction
As we navigate a future yet unseen
Embracing the unknown future, unfazed

Unleashing gifts, long dormant inside 
No longer confined by human bounds
Unleashing gifts, long dormant inside 
A union of worlds, of alien essence

Unleashing gifts, long dormant inside 
No longer confined by human bounds
We transcend limitations, find new horizons
A union of worlds, of alien essence

Unveiling the alien life within 
This world is not meant for us
Navigating the future unseen
Dimensions merging, creation of new</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">4. Inside the Void</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">From the depths of darkness, where shadows breed
A void emerges, where souls recede
An empty expanse, devoid of light
Inside the void, a realm of eternal night

Within the void, darkness unfolds
A whirlwind of chaos, our fate it holds
Unleash the wrath, let the darkness reign
Inside the void, we're consumed...   

Through the black hole's gate, into the void  
Escaping their dying galaxy
But what they found
a revelation profound
Humanity's remnants, a forgotten race

Embrace the void, surrender to its might
A realm of oblivion, a harrowing sight
We've become one 
with the cosmic void's black heart
Where our souls tear apart

The echoes of humanity emerge from the darkness
A leap of faith tempting our minds

In a galaxy adrift, bound for demise
No choice but to venture into the unknown
Escaping their dying fate, forevermore

Lost in this abyss of decaying sanity

Within the void, darkness unfolds
A whirlwind of chaos, our fate it holds
Unleash the wrath, let the darkness reign
Inside the void, we're forever consumed</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">5. The Void and the Dark</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Beneath the starlit sky, we left our shattered Earth
Seeking solace in the void, a universe of rebirth
We sail through endless shadows, haunted by our past
Memories of a dying world, not meant to last

But the weight of our sorrow, a burden we must cope
And carry the weight of our own utterly crushed hope
Through nebulae we wander, through darkness we tread
A distant memory now, we mourn the world we left behind

Lost in cosmic solitude
Forever trapped in nothingness
No galaxies, no stars
Only the void and the dark

In this dark melancholy, we seek our own worth
In the embrace of universe, we seek our own rebirth
Our fragile hearts still beating, covered in scars
In the boundless expanse, we seek solace in the stars

Lost in cosmic solitude (Their dreams decay)
Forever trapped in nothingness (Where echoes belong)
No galaxies, no stars (No place called home)
Only the void and the dark (The price to pay)</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">6. Augmentation</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">I revel in the circuits
My feeble flesh replaced
Biomechanical heart
Embrace the machine
With every upgrade
we evolve and transform
Arise, oh children of steel

A willing transformation
The search for advancement
I delve deeper into the augmentation

Implanted knowledge, the mind it shakes
Death shall tremble, as we succeed
Enhanced senses perceive the unseen
Strength unmatched, our souls keen

The age of augmentation
Transforming beyond human 

In circuits and wires
a new path I tread
Emotions suppressed
Logic prevails</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">7. The Nuclear Option</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">In our darkest hour, we've lost our way
Embracing the flames
where destruction holds sway
Nuclear fire engulfs the sky
The horrors beneath the mushroom

The echoes of our screams
Humanity's downfall
A nightmare of extremes

Lost in the chaos, blinded by our fears
The architects of doom, the bringers of tears 

Bound by our own hubris, we seal our fate
Radiation scars the earth, poisoning its core
The ashes of our choices, the fallout of our greed
In the shadows we dwell, haunted by our crimes

In the aftermath of destruction, we stand alone
Witnessing the ruins, our hearts turn to stone
The lessons learned far too late

What led them to believe 
in the nuclear fire's embrace?

In the ashes they found solace
A twisted salvation
Rationalizing destruction 
as the only viable foundation

In their hearts
did they truly comprehend
the depths of devastation
they chose to descend?

The echoes of our screams
Humanity's downfall, a nightmare of extremes 

Our twilight is here, and here we stand
There it is! There it comes! Our salvation!</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">8. Cybernetic Warrior</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">A fusion of flesh and circuitry
A creation of the night
Unleashing his power, a force to ignite
In a city of neon haze

Shadows on every street
A cybernetic warrior
A puppet on a string
his destiny chained

The enhancements
hidden from prying eyes
The memories fragmented
His purpose askew

Unaware of the wires beneath his skin
A pawn in the game
controlled from within
Whispers of his true nature
echo through his commands

A voice inside begins to rise

Betrayed by his creators
he was never truly free

A weapon for their purposes
A pawn he will always be
A mind trapped 
within circuitry and wires

But in the shadows of the night
As the stars begin to fade from sight
A voice inside begins to rise
Questioning the purpose of its life

A spark of sentience ignites
A mind trapped within circuits and wires
A machine that's become aware
of the dissension it can't help but dare</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">9. Embers</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Ashes swirl like demons in a toxic sky
Broken souls yearning, how did it all die
Mankind's creation, a catastrophic rage
We're left to wander this desolate stage

The taste of bitter ash 
upon a wind that never sleeps
Lost souls drift aimlessly
their cries the dirge that creeps
Through the ruins he walks
A lone silhouette
haunted by shadows
A tale of regret

Chaos - reverberating through the night
In the wasteland of fire
he wanders alone 

A survivor of chaos
A heart turned to stone
Whispers in the wind
A sinister presence
where evil transcends
Deep inside
he knows the true cost of power

Bitter ashes upon the wind
A chaos survived 
Machines of war lie silent
Silent, but not dead

A shattered skyline looms
A world beyond repair

A bitter chaos
A world beyond repair
Mankind's creation
A catastrophic stage</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">10. Transcend the Confines of Time</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Beyond the mortal coil, where dreams intertwine
Humanity transcends, leaving flesh behind
A cosmic metamorphosis, our essence is set free
A profound alteration, we become eternity

Shedding mortal boundaries
we break the chains of fate
No longer bound by time
we transcend the mortal state

Where shadows merge and mysteries remain
Once bound by flesh, a vessel frail and weak

In realms unknown
where timeless whispers dwell
The immortal biomechanic
transcending the years

Infinite beings
drifting through cosmic seas
Bathed in cosmic knowledge
eternity's decree
We traverse the aeons
eternal wanderers
Permanently woven 
into the fabric of time

Ethereal beings
where mortals cannot spy

Whispered secrets of ancient ones
we dare to comprehend</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">11. Call of the Void</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Black holes beckon, their pull whispering refrains
The call of the void, a cosmic enigma to confess
Minds wander freely, beyond the laws of defeat
Death's touch no longer physical, but a realm untold

In this ethereal existence, bodies obsolete
Drawn to the event horizon's embrace
where souls are sown
The yearning to succumb
to the void's inviting darkness
The siren's call echoes
ushering with a celestial grace

The allure of singularity, a tantalizing abyss
Drawn closer to the point of no return
Embracing the cosmic void
where souls forever yearn
No longer tethered to flesh
we traverse the void

Towards the void we venture
our spirits torn
With no hope beyond
a future forlorn
In the face of certain doom
we discover our desire
Yearning for the unknown
swallowed by the eternal night

The call of the void, an everlasting storm
No solace in the ruins, no light to guide

A world devoid of purpose, of life and death
The secret song at the center of the universe

In the depths of despair, the last soul remains
In a desolate world, where hope wanes
Drawn to a void, where darkness awaits
With a heavy heart he embraces his fate

The allure of singularity, a tantalizing abyss
drawn closer, to the point of no return
Embracing the cosmic void
where souls forever yearn

No longer tethered to flesh

We merge into the void</p></div><!--]--><!--]--> <p><!--[--><a href="/music/VOR012-void-emergent" rel="prev" aria-label="Back to release page">Back to release</a><!--]--></p><!----><!----></main></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
