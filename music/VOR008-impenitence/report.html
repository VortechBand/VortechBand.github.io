The songs on this EP however didn't feel like they fit the style of the main album, but were still cool songs, so we decided to make an EP out of them. It was supposed to be out around the time The Occlusion was released, but got postponed.

During the timeframe between composing the songs Hindrance of Existence, The Observers, Devour the Being and Uncreation and the actual work towards the EP, three more songs were eventually added in to make it a nice collection EP. 

The song Humanicide is of course a more traditional version of the song Mechanicide that was on The Occlusion. The song Singularity was an outtake from the ...of What Remains sessions in early 2014. Being much closer to the style of The Occlusion, this EP was a natural place to put it in. And finally, the song Genetic Structures is actually an outtake from the Wasteland sessions all the way back in summer 2006, but completely reworked for this release.

The theme for the lyrics was basically around the classic hidden characters among humans, forcing the course of the planet and causing a mass exodus to a different planet. That theme will partially continue in the upcoming 2025(?) album which doesn't have a tittle yet. The lyrics for the original 5 songs were written during the sessions for The Occlusion, in April 2013, and the 2 additional songs got their lyrics just prior to recording the EP, in May 2019.

The actual recording was done in June 2019, although the songs were much older. The recording was the first time I used an Evertune equipped guitar, and it was really pleasant to record with as you didn't have to worry about tuning almost at all. The bass was recorded at the same time and was the usual one in Ibanez BTB 555. For vocals, it was a straightforward job by myself and I used my SM7B for the first time in our recordings.

For the drums, instead of using the originally planned electronic drums, I finally went with the proven Addictive Drums 2, except for the drum and bass track Singularity that really is meant for electronic drums. This time around I also used the method originally used on ...of What Remains in that I first had the programmed drums in place, but then I played along with the Alesis PercPad to record human-played versions of the programmed notes, replacing them fully. Sounds quite nice, although this is the last recording that uses that method.

Once ready and happy with the mix, it was quite smooth going and the EP got released basically immediately after the recordings and mixing was done, in July 2019.
