In a period of about a week, 4 new songs were composed (Demon In the Circuitry, Chaos Dimension, The Black Rite and Pyre of Souls) of which two ended up on the Infocalypse EP released in the end of 2010.

The songs turned out a bit more electronic at first, but eventually more traditional songs started to appear as well, all the while we were quite active in rehearsing and in the live show front! A second batch of songs were completed in early October 2009, with Neurovirus, Charcoal Earth and The Apocalypse being completed. Neurovirus was in fact so ready that we played the song live in March 2010. The song Frozen Machine was written towards the end of October and then there was a bit of a break as we rehearsed and played some shows around Finland.

In late 2009 - early 2010 it was time to start finalizing the songwriting and the ambient closing track Grains of Reality, and two faster pieces Lost and Wire Synapse were completed. There was already plenty of material for the album, but after then listening to the songs and working out a song order etc, it felt that the album still needed a bit of different types of songs. Those would be then finalized in spring 2010, in the form of Shattered Cities and Unveiling the Future. Thus the songwriting was complete.

The recording of the guitars and bass started in the summer of 2010 and were ready by autumn. At that time we also started writing lyrics, with the idea originally being that Matti would also write some lyrics. Eventually all lyrics were ready, and it was time to start recording vocals. Unfortunately there were some difficulties, and eventually Mikko would end up as the vocalist on the final album. The final vocals were recorded around summer 2011.

In an interesting twist, Ville also joined the band as the first real drummer, and he rehearsed hard to get all the exterme parts on the album in perfect edge! We rehearsed extensively around late 2010 onwards and later on in the spring of 2012, he recorded all the live drums together with his brother Teemu, and you can hear the awesome results on the album.

Now with all things finally ready, it was time to finalize the album for a release, and Teemu also handled the mixing duties, and we were finally able to unleash the record into the wild in April 2012. With growing interest, the album was also released as our very first factory-pressed CD in October 2012.
