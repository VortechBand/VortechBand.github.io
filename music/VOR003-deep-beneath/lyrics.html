The Awakening</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Deep down, legions under the sea
ancient beings dormant lie and wait for release
For the waters of the oceans lock them down
the aeons passed have been abound

The slimy vaults creak wide open
as the generator comes to life
Silent generators succumb the tide
and so shall They too be fully alive

Biomechanic creatures form their ranks
Platinum blades cycle and spin by flanks
Masterpiece of the Great Old Ones
Violent sadistic machine devoid of guns

But now beneath the hunter's moon
their unleashing all but soon
Bright blue lighting fire up in the room
their legions are ready to bring your doom

Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">2. Biodroid Legions</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Heed the signal from beyond our time
A grating screech echoes throughout the structure
Once that was, now left behind
They shall convey the final rupture

We - the bionic response
The Great Old Ones' end of line
Feel - our wrath upon thee
Creations set free from millennial confine

Convergence with reality, is this the
final hour of our ancient slumber
The beast they shouldn't have forgotten
is soon unleashed upon the frail and weak

Do they realize the gravity of the state
Therein lies the key to the ancient conflict
No one to answer their intertwined malice and hate
They are now masterless at the perils of a binary instinct</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">3. The Undying Storm</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Unknowing people watching the sea
Beneath the horror lurks
just underneath the restless surface
wide awake

Falter not when the time is upon thee
For steady you must be to tell the tale
of a sordid encounter - the beings of olden

The restless surface
A wide awake nightmare
Goosebumped flesh
Trembling before them

What is that you see?
Can it even be so real?
For hideous is their skin
which is no skin at all

They bear so remarkable resemblance
In their eyes you see yourself
But the malformation disheartens you

Even those strong of mind
if not even especially them
tread the thinnest straw of losing their mind

The forming storm
Paints a scene set for a crimson dawn
Shellshock the world
The grip of order unfurled

Biomechanical slaughter
Meticulous demons from the water
The perfect endoform
Brought along the undying storm

The twilight of humanity
a twist of irony befalls
The saviours are bringers of doom

Out in the driving rain
The Ones created for us to save
- They shall lead us to our grave

The change is here
There is nothing to stop them at all
The spawn of Cthulhu
Will forever more be our bane</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">4. Shadow Shapes</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">The shadows entice in vision
A form clad in derision
They slither through fields of gore
And they will come back for more

To describe their body
One would need to be insane
Hideous - a beast by design

The creatures gather pace
You shall be erased
Your final memory
buried under the goo

Yog-Shoggoth - heed his call
Forfeit your life - consumed in whole

The waves are calling, for
a message awaits with intention
Hear the words of the imprisoned son
The call of cthulhu - the great old one

Dark down the deeps
They linger, await for the call
Invasion of the shadowed shapes
Their bodies ethereal and devoid of hopes

Forgotten and buried so far in
lost memories far under the sea
Your time has come my depraved ones
Let the curse once again lay all to waste</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">5. Retribution</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Standing there, among the ruins
You wander through the blood and gears
The evident signs of a tragedy
There was none they could have done

The spawn of evil
an ageless cult
Those things made out of steel and bionic mass

In pursuit through the woods and blackened substance
Whatever they may be they for sure are no sound creations

Pull out your guns, for you feel them oh so near
Just in time to avoid its charge and sheer

Chaotic beings of sickening build
they must be to have done all this
As the sun falls below horizon
Thus begins your retribution

Your rifle is clacking again and again
Oceanic entities screech and squall
Echoes against the cliff alert them all
For it is time for you to fall, FALL!

The creatures divert their attention
Chitonic blades unfold and swing
Splattering blood all over the place
As they indulge their appetite for chase

Though you know it to be your last dawn
You press on to fight them all
Lock and load all your guns
Tonight They shall fall by tons

Chaotic beings of sickening build
they must be to have done all this
As the sun falls below horizon
Thus begins your retribution

Fall to your knees to discover the scene
Lamentations of all those who died
The voices of the dead twist your mind
There shall be no sleep tonight</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">6. Bewildered</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">What is it that you are hunting for?
Could it be that it was you all along?
Those monstrosities were all a creation of your distorted mind
Perversions of your own frail sanity and grime

Look down to your hands
Those spills are a tell-tale sign
In your mind the vile nausea
Gallops to overrun your dawn

Cthulhu, what have you done to me?
I did not ask for any of this
For this state there is only one known cure
And with fear and stutter you step to the edge

What was it that you were hunting for?
Could it be that it was you all along?
Those monstrosities were all a creation of your distorted mind
Perversions of your own frail sanity and grime

It is time for you to think it through
Never questioned any of it that you all but knew
Yourself it was that oh so devoutly heeded his call
Now at the time of revelation you lunge deep beneath</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">7. Deep Beneath</h3> <p class="noTopMargin"></p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">(instrumental)</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">8. Subjugation</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">There isn't a single soul around here, deep under
All you see is vast plains of sunken worlds so long gone
Then it hits you that you still haven't drowned, on the contrary
Breathing here so arbitrary for you know it to be in vain

The work of darkened age, devicing you through
Mystic truths fill out your blanks as if you already knew
But deep down you know it to be not just but exactly so
You have been here before all those ages ago

The rusty thoughts spring out to your eyes
For your life so far has been all lies

Injection to your mind
Adduction to the blind
Refined process of subjugation

There is one brooding darkness to confront
Spawn of Cthulhu to suffer the blunt

'Show yourself, oh Great Old One!'
'I am here to eternally punish you for what you have done!'
'Oh the pain giving has just begun'

'Show yourself, oh Great Old One!'
'I am here to eternally punish them for what they have done!'

And thus was his mind all undone</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">9. Exile Within</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">Restless phase so common these days, find yourself lost in a haze
How can this be, what is it that you feed?
Those memories for sure cannot be wrong, what you feel is not all that's been going on
Conjure up your two selfs - see which one does not belong

Now the world is shifting around you
Before your eyes it turns untrue
Once again you discover it false
Yet you still brace all its faults

Life in a world out of phase
steers you so far in daze
What anymore is real and not beyond
or has it all been moving on?

Arcane, forgotten past
Knowledge of uttermost importance turned aghast
Face the reaper of reality
The drainer of human vitality

The desert offers you no more hope than the other world currently
in ruins - drowned in smoke but there is something so very, very wrong
about the way those sands keep shifting under the very eyes of yourself
The way it feels is like this plane would not even be but in your very mind</p></div><div class="track"><h3 class="noBottomMargin">10. So They Rise</h3> <p class="noTopMargin">Lyrics by Juha Untinen</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks greyText">So many things have come to pass
and what I have witnessed has left me a ruin
There are no words to describe what I saw
all I can recount is this log you read

As I write these words from beyond
Their invasion has already begun
There is nothing anyone can do
as the first few were just their skew

A fatal force marches on and on
Deep beneath their gathering is done
At the first break of dawn they rise
The Old Ones did so master a guise

But there it is, I can see their outlines take shape
Look there down at the oceanside
No use to gasp for air or speculate whence they came
The time has come to pass when all life is extinguished</p></div><!--]--><!--]--> <p><!--[--><a href="/music/VOR003-deep-beneath" rel="prev" aria-label="Back to release page">Back to release</a><!--]--></p><!----><!----></main></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
