  of recording techniques and writing some original songs, under the original band name Aftershock
  in early 2000. The name was soon changed to Sound Ogre after it was found out there were plenty of
  bands with the name Aftershock. Many of the original songs were posted to mp3.com which was fairly
  popular back in the years 2000-2001, even locally. As a fair amount of encouraging comments were
  received, the idea of writing more songs of our own got sparked and we quickly had two demos
  ready, called Beta and Pulsebeat. This was still under the Sound Ogre moniker. A third demo,
  Death.com, was completeled but never published. However, two of the songs from that demo were
  played in our first live performance - Endless Stairs and Loppusyksy. The former would later
  appear on the first Sound Ogre EP called Extinct (2004), which also featured the third song from
  the show (The Sentence Is Death).</p> <p>A new EP was starting to form in 2002, with 4 new songs taking shape but never published. One of
  those was getting fairly close to the style of the two published Sound Ogre EPs - the previously
  mentioned Extinct, as well as the follow-up EP Asphyxiation (2005). These two EPs would already be
  reminiscent of what would eventually be the Vortech sound. Still instrumental, the second EP was
  going to have vocals, but eventually no vocalist was found to finish them. It was also far more
  experimental in style and structure, something that would later be present on the album Deep
  Beneath (2008). During this time, the idea of creating a full length album started to brew.</p> <h3>The beginning of Vortech (2005-2008)</h3> <p>Since Tero had become busy with other projects - for example Relativity, that Juha would later
  join - it was now Juha working on the music himself. So as the style would also change a little
  bit, it was of course logical to come up with a new name for the project. And after a while, the
  source became, as often is the case, a lyric or a name from one of the band's favourite bands. In
  this case, the song duo Vortech I and Vortech II by the British industrial metal band Cubanate. It
  wasn't known what Vortech meant, but it sure sounded cool! And later on, it became even cooler to
  discover it is a fairly famous supercharger manufacturer for fast cars! Very suitable for the
  music style! Following the name change in late 2005, the first demos were recorded, but never
  released.</p> <p>In early 2006, the songwriting for what would become the first full length album, Conclusion
  (2006), started and the album was ready in fairly short order. The first four songs ended up on
  the album almost as-is, followed by the rest of the songs written just as quickly. With the
  success of getting the album ready so quickly, it was time to immediately start writing the next
  album. The next six months from May 2006 onwards were spent demoing songs for what would
  eventually become the popular album Wasteland (2007).</p> <p>Note that you can find more details about specific albums' recording session in their studio
  reports, which you can view through the <a href="/music">Music</a> section on this site.</p> <p>And with Wasteland being ready in early 2007, it was time to compose more songs for what would
  finally end up becoming Deep Beneath (2008). The entire album was written while waiting for the
  guest vocalists to record their parts for Wasteland, so Deep Beneath was released less than 6
  months after the release of Wasteland!</p> <h3>The busy era (2008-2014)</h3> <p>Things started moving fast following the release of Deep Beneath, with Mikko Särkimäki joining the
  band during the recording sessions. In the spring of 2008, we started to rehearse extensively for
  future live shows. This was also a time when the writing process for our most popular album,
  Posthumanism (2009), started. The entire album was ready by the end of the year, and we even
  rehearsed some of the new songs. So much so, that in the first show we did in June 2009, we played
  4 of the 11 songs on the album!</p> <p>Around August 2009, it was also time to start writing more songs. These would be ready by spring
  2010, but would take another 2 years to be released in the form of Devoid of Life, with Mikko
  Nikula on voicals and Ville Miinala playing live drums on the album. We also continued rehearsing
  heavily and also writing the next album, The Occlusion (2014) little by little.</p> <p>With The Occlusion having a very different style, Ville eventually continued with other projects
  and we continued recording with Mikko Nikula. During this time, the songwriting for what would
  become ...of What Remains (2015) had also started and continued until summer 2014. Once the
  songwriting for the album was ready, there was a bit of a break, while waiting for the vocals to
  be recorded, that was spent experimenting with some new recording techniques.</p> <h3>The current era (2015 onwards)</h3> <p>The songwriting for The Shadow Presence (2022) started already in February 2015, and continued
  until around summer 2017. While the entirety of the album's instruments were recorded back in
  early Autumn 2018, the release took quite a bit longer and ended up with a new guest vocalist
  joining in. The style was again similar to the classic Posthumanism-Of What Remains era, with some
  new things included.</p> <p>The process had been fairly fine-tuned by now, so the sessions for the - as of now, unreleased -
  9th full length album technically began in early 2022, but as it has songs from through the years,
  the oldest song dates back to 2016!. The majority of the songs are from the February Album Writing
  Month sessions between 2016-2022. The album recording is just about ready, with some vocals left
  to do before release, sometime in the end of 2025!</p> <p><a href="/bio">Back to Biography</a></p><!----><!----></main></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
