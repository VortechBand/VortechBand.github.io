Exciting times also as it was the first time playing with drums coming from a multitrack source, and also reamped second guitar and bass! But everything went really smoothly and with just two actual people we still managed to create quite a ruckus! The tracklist features all our favourites at that point and the venue was really nice, with some friends in attendance as well as lots of other people. Maybe around 50-60 people total, for this small-ish club.",others:["Catamenia","Kätyri"]},{date:"2009-08-22",city:"Liminka",country:"FI",venue:"Okkult Tupos Attakk Festival",setlist:["Their Contract","Shedding the Flesh","Lifeline","Evolutionary Project","Afterworld","Impulse","Biodroid Legions","Destined to Fall","The Awakening"],performers:[{name:"Juha Untinen",instrument:"Guitar, Electronics"},{name:"Matti Särkimäki",instrument:"Vocals"}],report:"Only after one show, it was already time to play at a festival, of course! In a secluded town south of Oulu, it still managed to gather a lot of people and we had plenty of chats with people prior to the show.

Always a great blast playing in this legendary small club! The house was quite full and this time tried out a bit special way to have our backing tracks in the PA - just a simple mp3-player! But even that worked out great and still sounded okay in a very small place. The people seemed to enjoy the show and this time Matti compiled the setlist out of his favourite tracks, making it a little bit different from previous shows.",others:["Magpie","Dörrterror (SWE)"]},{date:"2009-12-03",city:"Raahe",country:"FI",venue:"Rytmikellari",setlist:["The Awakening","Their Contract","Impulse","Shedding the Flesh","Biodroid Legions","Retribution","The New Creations","Evolutionary Project","Destined to Fall"],performers:[{name:"Juha Untinen",instrument:"Guitar, Electronics"},{name:"Matti Särkimäki",instrument:"Vocals"}],report:"Very moody and cool show in a venue with plenty of personality and personalities! This time the show was again with our traditional setup and we had plenty of fun playing for a new audience a bit more due south from our usual grounds.

We had again plenty of friends listening, even all the way from Spain! The show went great and it was a blast to play with the audience well into the music.

We had our full setup and had a great time playing for the local audience in another new city.
