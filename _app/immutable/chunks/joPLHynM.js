Now finally finished!\\nHindrance of Existence - another piece that was once in our SoundCloud, plenty of energy and DnB influence. Very originally it was written all the way back in 2004, now in a more energetic form.\\nHumanicide - this one was done as a kind of bonus song during the sessions of The Occlusion, which had this song in a more industrial form. In here, the track is in a more traditional metal form.\\nSingularity - a track completed just after completing the The Occlusion sessions.

Perhaps that will lead to some special festives, but this will be seen in the future. However, one thing is for sure. There will be more music coming at a usual pace, and here's how I foresee the next few years:\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>We are soon ready with demoing the songs for the next full length album, with a working title of \\"...of What Remains\\". This album is more on the familiar style of Industrial Death Metal, like the Vortech you know best. Should all go well, this album might be out by the end of the year 2014, but it's all down to drum recording schedules. Ville will play real drums once more on the album with Mikko on vocals, and I will of course handle the other instruments. Expect an album closer to the style of Posthumanism than our previous releases.</li>\\n<li>Playing live is a target for us, and we have been rehearsing more actively this year, with a small summer break for personal reasons. We are on the lookout for opportunities to play live once more, and have a steady selection of 13 songs to pick from.</li>\\n<li>Should our finances allow for it, we will certainly work on getting Posthumanism and The Occlusion released on factory pressed CDs with full casing and artwork. Another goal is to have a few more t-shirt designs available, and possibly other merchandise (feel free to drop requests on FB!)</li>\\n<li>If you are a fellow musician, you can also send a message to us and we'll see if there's a chance for collaboration or a guest appearance on our albums! It's always fun to see how others interpret our material, so remixes and such are also more than welcome!</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\nSo, looking forward to the next years!\\n\\n- Juha / Vortech","created":"2014-07-29 18:34:00","id":281,"title":"Nearing a decade as Vortech!","updated":null},{"author":"Juha","categories":[],"contents":"The results of a very busy first half of the year are in! At the moment, 14 new songs are fully demoed, with a couple of more in the works (a few ambient pieces...), but I am still aiming to write some more songs before we will begin the usual process of converting the demos into an album!\\n\\nBut, not to keep you in too much suspense, here are the songs so far with a short description of each. They are listed in alphabetical order:\\n\\n<b>Battling With A Lion</b> (160 bpm)\\nA futuristic re-imagination of the old demo track. Lots of ambience. Quite energetic!\\n\\n<b>Blast Radius</b> (225 bpm)\\nThe song title says it all! An explosion of speed and fury, in a tightly packed powerhouse of a track. Get your industrial death metal grooves out! Just like in the mid-90's...\\n\\n<b>Disconnect</b> (210 bpm)\\nA dynamic mixture of blistering melodies and experimental verses. A view to the bitter dawn of a brave new future world. Ends with some nice synchronized madness between the kicks and guitars.\\n\\n<b>From the Void Arise</b> (172 bpm)\\nMore horror-styled mood, with some melancholic dark melodies. Slightly in the style of Posthumanism, but not quite as fast.\\n\\n<b>Ghosts of Existence</b> (284 bpm)\\nNow, if you thought Frozen Machine was ridiculously fast, check this out! Perhaps humanely impossible drums (Ville?), but all the more fun! Just sheer cold and (dark)spaced out black metal - until the end. Ohh, the end will leave you hanging on the edge... Did I mention the song is 7 mins 33 seconds long?\\n\\n<b>Industrial Complex, Pt. 1</b> (134 bpm)\\nAnd now for something completely different! Slightly looking back to our previous album, but more befitting the mood of this album in general. Dark industrial with some twisted grooves and chugging. Back to the mid-90's, Part 2. Good times!\\n\\n<b>Internal Poison</b> (240 bpm)\\nMelodic, fast and heavy. Classic Vortech style with some of the fastest triple picks ever for the band! Trying out some new ways to play keys/synths, and very dark industrial melodies. Originally written with a keyboard!\\n\\n<b>Neolithic (The Darkness Is Born)</b> (175 bpm)\\nAnother darker piece, re-constructed from two unfinished songs for the previous album. I can almost hear some Swedish influences here and there, but you will recognize it's us for sure!\\n\\n<b>Oceans of Steel</b> (218 bpm)\\nOne of my supreme favourites of the demos! Extremely energetic, industrialistic and heavy! Prepare for a rainy futuristic mid-part of pure dark beauty!\\n\\n<b>Predictable End</b> (147 bpm)\\nEven more industrial metal than most. Another energetic piece of sheer catchy heaviness! Oriental industrial? Anachronism, much? Trying out some strange new drum beats, and guitarless parts.\\n\\n<b>Proximity</b> (137 bpm)\\nIndustrial Motörhead? Who knows, but this is sheer darkness in industrial metal shape. Expect some more epic synth pads, and a heavy chorus!\\n\\n<b>Strength In Numbers</b> (132 bpm)\\nTake a journey into the space industrial-complex! Very melodic, crunchy and futuristic to the bone! With some experimental synths and segues into fast parts. Quite a fun song, and very atmospheric!\\n\\n<b>The Empty Vessel</b> (189 bpm)\\nExperimenting with samples and sound FX will sometimes lead into full songs! That's the story of this little piece that brings you heavy riffs! Simple but effective piece of madness! With a very nice breakdown to bring the enjoyability to the max!\\n\\n<b>Within the Fog</b> (260 bpm)\\nAlso a re-recording of an older outtake. This one from the Wasteland days! The song was ultimately unfinished and was left out of the album. Now's your chance to hear it in the modern days! Fast, traditional and with new atmospheric synths!","created":"2014-06-09 18:19:00","id":280,"title":"A Whole Lotta Music","updated":null},{"author":"Juha","categories":[],"contents":"Here's two videos from our rehearsals in Oulu a few days ago.

As mentioned, this album is highly electronic/industrial-oriented in the approach and expands the palette of Vortech to whole new levels!\\n\\nI've always likened the style of Vortech as a triangle where each corner has one of the three aspects: 1) Extreme Metal, 2) Industrial and Electronic, and 3) Progressive. Looking back, Deep Beneath leaned a lot towards the Progressive corner, while for example Posthumanism was in the Extreme corner along with Wasteland. This brand new album will be a case where the flag is hoisted firmly in the Industrial and Electronic corner.\\n\\nWe will also work on a second album this year, which will be in the more familiar Vortech grounds of Industrial Death Metal. But at the moment, the full effort is given for this electronic metal album, which has the working title \\"The Binary Hive\\". We will now begin to go through the songs to pick a suitable tracklist and do any adjustments to the songs if needed. The lyrics will also be written during this time, and once everythings ready, we will start to record the album!\\n\\nThat's it for the mean time!\\n- Juha","created":"2013-03-09 17:20:00","id":248,"title":"The Electronic Front!","updated":null},{"author":"Juha","categories":[],"contents":"You betcha!

I think I once described the song as Arcturus goes Testament.\\n\\n<b>Charcoal Earth</b>\\nEnergetic opening, with a melancholic verse slightly in Need for Speed II soundtrack style. End-time song and mood.\\n\\n<b>Demon In the Circuitry</b>\\nThe first song that was finished. Quite dark and driving, with an uplifting slightly egyptian chorus. A hard-hitting electronic interlude.\\n\\n<b>Frozen Machine</b>\\nHigh-speed black metal with lots of electronics. You can hear the demo version on our <a href=\\"http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal\\">Myspace</a> page. Maybe even slightly orchestral, but highly dark in the chorus.\\n\\n<b>Grains of Reality</b>\\nDark electro. Slightly ambient but very expressive. Ulver? Even darker. Will most likely be the album ending song.\\n\\n<b>Lost</b>\\nSome more black metal, this time a bit more straightforward. Still some dark melodies and a bit of speed. The kick drums really take advantage of being a machine ;) Something like 364 bpm...\\n\\n<b>Neurovirus</b>\\nThe first song to be played live from the album. Kind of Meshuggah-ish. Electronics, low tuning and some tricks. A really fun song.\\n\\n<b>Pyre of Souls</b>\\nPerhaps a small homage to mid-90's Waltari. It's actually made out of riffs that didn't fit the past two albums, but still sounded good. This time they did, when combined. Get your butt movin' and groovin'!\\n\\n<b>Shattered Cities</b>\\nVery industrial, with sample-based drums and electro beats. Quite dark overall, part of this song was going to be in a fully drum & bass type of song. Eventually the song developed into this one. New Breed?\\n\\n<b>The Apocalypse</b>\\nVery slow doom metal with synths and a piano. Haunting and eerie with a highly fitting title. Perhaps the last song on the album. \\n\\n<b>The Black Rite</b>\\nProbably the album opening song. High-paced and energetic, with a nice mood. Very melodic chorus, with sudden black metal changes.\\n\\n<b>Unveiling the Future</b>\\nPunk/Hardcore? With a slight blackish touch, â­¡ Zyklon, but really something I haven't heard before anywhere. No blastbeats! ;)\\n\\n<b>Wire Synapse</b>\\nSlightly fast with more hardcore things and electronics. Maybe a little SYL-like chorus, but darker. A lot of space synths in Darkspace style.\\n\\n\\nWill the album be called \\"Devoid of Life\\", time will tell ;) The artwork has progressed well.

Okay, let's see. These are in alphabetical order:\\n\\n<b>Chaos Dimension</b>\\nA bit slower (in Vortech scale :D) with lots of melody and synths, but the chorus goes down a dark path towards (you guessed it!), chaos feel in the first two appearances of the chorus, with a nice lead line replacing the grand piano in the remaining choruses. Imagine opening a door and stepping out to a thunderstorm.\\n\\n<b>Charcoal Earth</b>\\nThe quick intro leads you right into a melodic black metal kind of chorus, followed by a melancholic verse part where the synths take the stage. Soon the mood goes towards darkness... I think the verse has a lot of Need for Speed II/III intro music feel. A bit more experimental in the later parts of the song. Overall somewhat lush, but uneasy in mood.\\n\\n<b>Demon In the Circuitry</b>\\nThe first song written for the upcoming album. Starts with some tentative blasting, leading into a mysterious verse. The chorus lets it loose, leading back to a Millennium era FLA-like dark thingy. On the second time, the chorus gets a nice lead addition, much in Deep Beneath spirit. Then it's time to stop and hammer down an intense breakdown with lots of processed synth.\\n\\n<b>Frozen Machine</b>\\nThe most extreme song I've done for Vortech. All out black metal at 262 bpm with lots of mountain-high orchestral synths, ridiculous shredding rhythms and a desperate lead guitar line. And back to some more fireworks and leads. And some more muscular blasting :P A brief slow part, picking up the pace in no time, leading into the snowstorm of a chorus. Think of Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, taking place in the future...\\n\\n<b>Neurovirus</b>\\nThe future is grim indeed, in a bit more thrash-like song, with a nice twist. Fear Factory goes Meshuggah? A bit eastern in the chorus, followed by a melodic post-chorus. Then it's blast-time, and back to some tricksy palm mutes.\\n\\n<b>Pyre of Souls</b>\\nNow this is an interesting piece. And yes, this song was written before Devin released Addicted! :) An upbeat, very industrial metal song in pure mid-90's Waltari style, but with some twisted melodies. This song is actually compiled of some excellent outtake riffs from the Posthumanism sessions, that didn't fit into the other songs, but sounded great on their own. Get your ass shakin' :D\\n\\n<b>The Apocalypse</b>\\nWhat else would a song with a title like that be? Blastbeat and shr... well, actually it's a doom metal song :D From 262 bpm down to 80 bpm! Very slow and haunting, with more synths than your average doom song, but that's what experimentation is about ;) Think of H.P. Lovecraft in song form. Very eerie, mysterious and dark. Quite a different style than the other songs, and it's possibly the album ending song.\\n\\n<b>The Black Rite</b>\\nA monster of a chorus! Very epic and grand, plus heavy of course. Somewhat more in the progressive vein of Deep Beneath, but with more synths and devilish melodies. One of my favourite songs of these eight, and will end up in our live set for sure. It already sounds like an excellent song to end a show with!\\n\\n\\nSo there you go, a quick description of the songs finished so far. I will keep writing songs until new year or so, including some ambient stuff again, and there's also a few unfinished songs left to complete. Overall, I think there will be 15 songs from which I will select the final 10-11 songs for the album. Should be a nice continuation to the Vortech timeline! No idea of when it will be finished, but more than likely it will be spring 2010 or so, as usual ;)","created":"2009-11-18 17:17:00","id":152,"title":"Progress towards album #5","updated":null},{"author":"Juha","categories":[],"contents":"Our webhost screwed up the domain update and that's why you saw the ad page for a while.

The first chorus is quite an evil sounding one, followed by a very old school Swedish death metal style main chorus.\\n\\n<b>Astral Breed</b> (3:58) [145 bpm]\\nA midtempo song with a mysterious main verse. The second part takes up the first space shuttle available. The chorus is a very sneaky one combining trance with a black metalish slower guitarline.\\n\\n<b>Bleak Expectations</b> (4:52) [220 bpm]\\nStarts out with some synth work, followed by some technical riffage with more black metal touches. The chorus is very melodic with lots of synth stuff and arpeggios. The C part contains black metal and more space-synths, with a nice solo spot later on.\\n\\n<b>Humanity: Static</b> (5:41) [156 bpm]\\nVery driving song all around, with lots of electronics and synths. A nice mystical and evil sounding chorus. Could be the album opener.\\n\\n<b>Posthumanism</b> (3:54) [256 bpm]\\nExtremely fast stuff, with a nice twisted melody-riddled chorus and lots of time signature changes. Very futuristic sound. Another candidate for an album opener.\\n\\n<b>The Wolves</b> (4:39) [157 bpm]\\nStarts out with an oriental style shredfest, followed by a futuristic setting going towards a very electronic chorus. Lots of heavy riffs.\\n\\n<b>Transcendence</b> (3:31) [157 bpm]\\nThe first song composed after Deep Beneath. Nice and futuristic with a nice drive. The chorus may get a small change, but at the moment it's got a nice melody going on. The C-part features completely over the top drum machine work.\\n\\n<b>Xenomorphosis</b> (4:17) [244 bpm]\\nFast stuff with a very futuristic feeling, fans of the original Need for Speed soundtrack will feel at home, especially during the chorus.

But first we need to rehearse the songs with Kraken during the summer and also see if it's feasible to perform with just two guys. If there's gigs, they will most likely be in this area (Tornio-Kemi-Oulu, maybe Rovaniemi) and perhaps in Sweden (Haparanda, Luleå¡¡nd maybe Umeå©® I will also try to record those gigs and see how it works. Maybe put out a live album for fun, or just have them available for download. We'll see.\\n\\nI'll also start composing for the next Vortech album this summer, as usual, and aim for a release in the first quarter of 2009. So far there's just some material I came up with during the DB sessions and some other things, but nothing full yet.","created":"2008-04-04 07:59:00","id":70,"title":"Downloads and Updates","updated":null},{"author":"Juha","categories":[],"contents":"Today marks the release of Deep Beneath, the latest installment of the Vortech saga.
