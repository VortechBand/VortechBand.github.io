total silence\\nA darkened existence\\nAn eerie dust covers the scene\\nFaint crackling of things coming apart\\n\\nThere is a serene peace throughout the face of the earth\\nWhere the wind blows and flattens the carbon figures\\n\\nA new life forms from the scattered pieces\\nBut who can be sure, perhaps the cycle repeats\\n\\nThe emptiness that fills the void\\nThe screaming sounds of
