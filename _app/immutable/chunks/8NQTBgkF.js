We are once again joined by ICanBeFree who will provide the majority of the vocals for the album. And as mentioned earlier, there will be also some other surprises in the vocal department!

The test mixes are sounding very nice, so once all vocals are ready, we should have a new album out in very short time. Possibly sometime around September 2025!`,created:"2025-07-20 13:55:00",id:365,title:"Vocal recording begins",updated:null},{author:"",categories:["Website","recording"],contents:`Work continues on the upcoming 9th album with demo vocals being finalized now, which will be the basis for the final vocals. All instruments are already ready to go, so we are getting very close to release!

As mentioned previously, we will also have a new website starting from July, as the current service will end. It will still be in the same address <a href="https://vortechmusic.com">https://vortechmusic.com</a> however. But if are interested, you can already see an in-progress version of the website here: <a href="https://vortechband.github.io/">https://vortechband.github.io/</a>. The news there are just examples.

I have added some new studio reports there, so now every release has a studio report. Some based on the older ones from around 2008 with some small additions here and there, and some reports are brand new. Have a look-see in the Music -> Album -> Studio report section in that new site.`,created:"2025-04-09 17:07:32",id:364,title:"Future website",updated:"2025-04-09 17:08:48"},{author:"Vortech",categories:["recording"],contents:`All bass tracks were finished earlier this month and they sound cool!

Clocking in at about 49 minutes. Most of the songs are further enhanced compared to the demo versions, with lots of new leads, updated drums and altered sections. Expect a bit more furious experience, with plenty of scifi.`,created:"2023-11-30 22:19:20",id:362,title:"Recording time!",updated:null},{author:"Juha",categories:["preproduction"],contents:`Not a surprise to some, but yes, it is indeed time to start the process that will end with the release of our next album!

Now it is time to start fleshing them out, adding all kinds of tricks, and writing the lyrics. Also known as preproduction. All things going smoothly, it should be out sometime in 2023...
