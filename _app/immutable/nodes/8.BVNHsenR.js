At first I had four full songs, which all in fact were also featured on the released album. The tracks went by the names Epidural Venom (The Institution), Prophecy of Unknown (Terra Ultimatum), Acid Capacitor Detonation (Sentinels of Pain) and Thoughtless (Judgement of the Amenti). The songs took their final form very quickly with very few changes in structures and riffs on the way. The album was originally intended to include the two demo songs that were available at our MySpace site: Bewildered Beyond Disknowledge and Battling with a Lion.\\n\\nBut eventually I decided it would be nicer to have just brand new songs to allow for the album to sound more fresh. I may rework and record those two demo tracks later on, as I still feel they're quite nice songs on their own. In late February 2006 I finished two more songs. The progress was a little slower than on Wasteland since I pretty much finished each song right on the spot. I didn't do any demo tracks, I simply composed the songs and recorded all the guitars on the fly. By the end of the month, I had finished all the songs for the album. Then it was time to start writing the rest of the lyrics.\\n\\nAnd just when I thought everything had gone nicely, it turned out I had to re-record the guitars for two songs due to poor quality. Luckily the songs turned out even better after the re-recording. The lyrics came together extremely quickly after I had a perfect vision of what I wanted the lyrics to be about. That is, the moments on Earth at the verge of the collapse of the universe. The vocals were recorded in early April and the album was finally completed after just over a week into April.\\n\\nThe mix of this album is quite experimental, as you have no doubt heard. I experimented with several different things, including applying a guitar amp simulation plugin (Guitar Suite) on top of the real recorded guitars, and the drums are a combination of three different drum machines.\\n\\n== Equipment used\\n\\nGuitars\\n\\n- Schecter 007 Blackjack\\n- Engl Powerball + Engl Vintage 2x12 (Celestion V30)\\n- Shure SM57 aiming at a small angle towards the center of the speaker\\n- Behringer MX602A mixer as a preamp\\n\\nThere's also the GuitarSuite JCM900 VST on all the guitars, making a really strange tone\\n\\nVocals\\n\\n- Shure SM57\\n- Behringer MX602A\\n\\nMixing\\n\\n- M-Audio Audiophile 2496 sound card\\n- Behringer Truth B2030A monitors","reportDate":"2008-07-23"},{"releaseCode":"VOR002","releaseTitle":"Wasteland","report":"The project was started at around 1 AM on June 8th 2006, when some ideas were thrown about in Cubase. However, not much happened for the next 30 days - only some unused riffs and some drum beats were composed. Things started rolling in early July when a number of songs were initially completed (not much remains of those though :P), namely Anthropomoph, Impulse and Ominous Dawn. A few days later, two more songs were done: Artificial and Perdition (only the chorus remains to date). This provided to be a fruitful start towards writing the album, though.\\n\\nThe second writing session took place in mid-August, when an older song (The Core) was sliced apart completely and reworked from ground up with only the main rhythm riff remaining from the original. A number of new songs were also composed, but only two of those made it to the album. The outtakes included tracks entitled The Remnants of Apocalypse, Blood Tribunal, Lord of Worms and Process. The two that actually did make the album are nowadays called Instigate Hostile Reaction and The Silence.\\n\\nA third writing session occured in early October, and during those sessions the remaining new songs were fully written. After that phase, it was time to start going through all the material and improve on them. After strenuous days and moments, the songs were finally shaping up to be how they are today. The drum programming was also pretty much finalized during that month. Not many changes were done.\\n\\nNovember was a mind-rest month in a way, as very few things were done to the songs or arrangements, though a few did happen. Mainly it involved changing the order in which the riffs came in the song. Also, the initial work towards the concept and storyline of the album was started. Stephen King's The Stand, the Fallout series and Mad Max movies were a big inspiration, which lead to a story about the final days of mankind before a great nuclear slaughter and the days after the events.\\n\\nIn late December it was finally time to start recording all the guitars for the album. Everything went extremely smoothly and the job was done in just three days of active recording. Each song has two rhythm guitars, panned 100% each side, plus a lead guitar track in the center. The sound turned out to be quite nice and clear, fitting well inside the songs. As I had already finished all the bass and drum programming earlier, all the songs were pretty much done now. The last thing left to do was to finish up all the lyrics for the album and testing how the vocals would be like, stuff like phrasing, emphasizes and so on.\\n\\nThen began the strange days. The album was ready, including the lyrics, but the vocal recordings didn't take off anywhere. But then things started to happen and eventually most of the vocals were recorded by Matti. A few songs were left without vocals, so I finally recorded the remaining parts to finish up the album and finally release it on September 23, 2007.\\n\\nThe guitars on this album feature two tracks of rhythm guitar plus one lead guitar. They were recorded with an Engl Powerball on the third channel (Lo Lead) with gain at 2, lo lead bottom on, bass at 4, mid-focused at 10, Treble at 8, channel volume on 10, presence on 7, depth punch at 4 and master volume at just over 1. Kind of funky settings, but they seem to work quite nicely with the amp and cab (Engl Vintage 2x12 with Celestion V30 speakers).\\n\\nThe bass on this album was originally programmed with Spectrasonic's Trilogy, which had a decent bass sound. But it required a bit of tweaking to make the sound less machinegun-like. It did fit very well inside the songs, but I ultimately re-recorded all bass parts. The bass was first done with Tero's Fender Mexico Jazz Bass tuned to drop-B through a Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI. But since I bought an Ibanez BTB555-MP that summer, I again re-recorded all bass parts with it and those are the ones on the final album.\\n\\nAll the drums were done with Toontrack's EzDrummer, which is simply great. Very good quality drums almost straight out of the box. Just some minor tweaks overall to make it sound more suited for a metalish style. The drum tracks received the standard handling: some midscoop and bass/treble boost on the kick, compression on the snare, distortion and midscoop for the toms and a 600 Hz highpass for the overheads.\\n\\nMy vocals were recorded on a ghetto Athlon XP + Reaper v1.888 system at Relativity's rehearsal space. The mic was the workhorse Shure SM57 into a Behringer MX602A mixer into Audiotrack Inca 88. It actually wasn't too bad of a system for some rough vocals. The album features guest vocals from several people, and it was the first time to experience something like that. The method was then used later on as well, even on the very latest Vortech albums!\\n\\n== Equipment used\\n\\nGuitars\\n\\n- Behringer MX602A mixer as a preamp\\n- Shure SM57 on-axis 1 cm from the grille aiming just about dead straight at the speaker\\n- Engl Powerball + Engl Vintage 2x12 (Celestion V30)\\n- Schecter 007 Blackjack in standard tuning (BEADGBE)\\n\\nBass\\n\\n- Ibanez BTB555-MP (tuned standard: BEADG)\\n- Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI\\n\\nVocals\\n\\n- Shure SM57\\n- Behringer MX602A\\n- Audiotrak Inca88 interface\\n\\nMixing\\n\\n- RME Fireface 400 interface\\n- Behringer Truth B2030A monitors","reportDate":"2008-08-06"},{"releaseCode":"VOR003","releaseTitle":"Deep Beneath","report":"The project Deep Beneath started way back in June 2007 when I composed two tracks (Shadow Shapes and Retribution) while waiting for Matti to finish his vocals for Wasteland. Early next month another track was finished (Exile Within, originally titled The Six Phases of Unrest) and then I took a small break from songwriting to continue mixing Wasteland with the first batch of vocal tracks I received. Then a bit later in mid-August, I composed a whole bunch of songs within four days: The Undying Storm, Biodroid Legions and So They Rise (originally Voidforms). Then it was time to finish up Wasteland, so I didn't compose any songs for a while.\\n\\nThen in November 2007 I finally composed a further three new songs: Subjugation (originally called Rust), The Awakening (originally Re.Activate) and Deep Beneath, which also pretty much locked me on the direction which the album would take. Then in December I also re-recorded and re-arranged an older demo track of mine that never found a home earlier, and it fit perfectly for this album. Bewildered (aka Bewildered Beyond Disknowledge) was then finished and now I had an albumfull of material.\\n\\nIn early January 2008, I started working on the lyrics for the songs and they were quickly finished in two weeks. Then it was time to start working on the final DI guitars for the album. All the guitar DI tracks were finished on 30 January and it was time to start recording the DI bass tracks. A big bunch of videos were filmed of the guitar tracking and there will be a compilation video. All DI recordings were finished on 31 January and demo vocal recordings started.\\n\\nIn early February, I did the first reamping home tests and after getting an extra adapter I got it all working together perfectly. So now with the knowledge, I started reamping everything soon after. The tone was a bit different than the usual albums in those days with the 5150/Dual Rectifier combo on all of them. It does sound nice and is sure to work, but most albums tend to end up sounding the same, so with my Engl Powerball + Marshall JCM900 SL-X it was going to be a bit different tone-wise.\\n\\nIn the initial reamping tests, I used the Fireface as an output going with a balanced signal into the Little Labs Redeye reamp box, and from there into the Engl Powerball and I had a Digitech Bad Monkey in front of the Marshall. The cabinet was dual miced with two Shure SM57s, both on-axis with the first one pointing at the center of the dustcap and the other one pointing at the edge of the speaker cone. From there the mics went into the Fireface. \\n\\nThe drum tracks are programmed with Addictive Drums and for synths etc there's a wide variety of different VSTi synths. My favourites so far have been reFX's Vanguard and Nexus and Reason 4.0's NN-XT choir patches.\\n\\nHowever, eventually I decided that the reamped guitars won't cut it, so it was back to the original choice of impulses and EQ spectrums. I finally got a very nice tone going on with a Krank Revolution + Engl Savage spectrum pair, with a Peavey 5150 spectrum for the lead guitars. All that is achieved through a DI guitar track first going into a preamp modeler (I used the excellent and free Wagner Sharp v0.60), into SIR1 with a custom impulse of a Mesa Standard 4x12 cabinet. And lastly there's Voxengo Curve EQ to provide the EQ spectrum side of the combo. All that is highly CPU intensive (it was a thing back in 2008...), so I had a separate project with nothing else but the DI guitars and I added the plugins into that and then exported as .wav and added them to the main project. I also decided to use just two rhythm guitars since the mix is already busy as hell, so I needed all the frequency space I could get.\\n\\nFor bass recording I used an Ibanez BTB 555 into Tech 21 Sansamp Bass Driver DI with both a dirty signal and pure DI signal going into RME Fireface 400. From there on, the signal went directly to Cubase with a temporary EQ cutting out some of the midrange. The Sansamp settings were at: Level 11 o'clock, Blend 100%, Treble 10 o'clock, Bass 12 o'clock, Drive 14:30 o'clock, Presence 14 o'clock.\\n\\nI also did demo vocals for all the songs, both to test out how the vocals finally fit in within the songs and also for Matti to practice the phrasing etc. For the demo vocals, I simply used my Shure SM57 into the Fireface 400. For the final vocals, we used two mics and then picked one to do the rest with. The first mic was Mikko's AKG C2000B and the other was a T.Bone SC450 cheapo mic, which we did end up using.\\n\\nThe vocal recordings started on 1 March 2008 with some fiddling and not much was caught on tape on the first day. The second day was more organized and we managed to record the vocal tracks for 3 songs. The sessions continued throughout the weekend of 29 Feb - 3 March and we managed to record the last remaining songs on 3 March, completing the vocal recording sessions. \\n\\n== Equipment\\n\\nGuitar\\n\\n- Schecter 007 Blackjack\\n- Wagner Sharp v0.60 + SIR1 + Voxengo Curve EQ\\n\\nBass\\n\\n- Ibanez BTB 555\\n- Straight into RME Fireface 400\\n\\nVocals\\n\\n- T.Bone SC450\\n\\nMixing\\n\\n- Cubase SX 3\\n- Behringer Truth B2030A","reportDate":"2008-07-23"},{"releaseCode":"VOR004","releaseTitle":"Posthumanism","report":"The composing of songs for the next Vortech record started in late June 2008, when three songs were completed in quick succession with working titles (in order of composition): Transcendence, Xenomorphosis and Posthumanism. During the next months, a total of 15 songs were done. The final narrowing down resulted in 11 songs being chosen for the album, and the post-preproduction (?!) could start in early December 2008. During post-preproduction all the songs were checked for final adjustments and the final drum programming.\\n\\nIn early January 2009, all the songs were finalized and the studio sessions began. Each song received a barrage of 2 rhythm guitar tracks, 2 lead guitar tracks and additional rhythm guitars at tactical positions. This time there will be no standalone ambient tracks, as the songs themselves featured the usual touches of ambience.\\n\\nAll guitar and bass tracks were finished on 18 January 2009. Both a clean DI signal and a dirty signal were recorded at the same time, allowing for more choices during mixing. Then it was time to start writing the lyrics for the album. During that time, we also went through all the videos and pictures from the recording sessions to compile into a nice coherent clip.\\n\\nA studio video was released on 7 February 2009, at which point 3,5 songs had finished lyrics with the progress being slow but steady with no rush.

In a period of about a week, 4 new songs were composed (Demon In the Circuitry, Chaos Dimension, The Black Rite and Pyre of Souls) of which two ended up on the Infocalypse EP released in the end of 2010.\\n\\nThe songs turned out a bit more electronic at first, but eventually more traditional songs started to appear as well, all the while we were quite active in rehearsing and in the live show front! A second batch of songs were completed in early October 2009, with Neurovirus, Charcoal Earth and The Apocalypse being completed. Neurovirus was in fact so ready that we played the song live in March 2010. The song Frozen Machine was written towards the end of October and then there was a bit of a break as we rehearsed and played some shows around Finland.\\n\\nIn late 2009 - early 2010 it was time to start finalizing the songwriting and the ambient closing track Grains of Reality, and two faster pieces Lost and Wire Synapse were completed. There was already plenty of material for the album, but after then listening to the songs and working out a song order etc, it felt that the album still needed a bit of different types of songs. Those would be then finalized in spring 2010, in the form of Shattered Cities and Unveiling the Future. Thus the songwriting was complete.\\n\\nThe recording of the guitars and bass started in the summer of 2010 and were ready by autumn. At that time we also started writing lyrics, with the idea originally being that Matti would also write some lyrics. Eventually all lyrics were ready, and it was time to start recording vocals. Unfortunately there were some difficulties, and eventually Mikko would end up as the vocalist on the final album. The final vocals were recorded around summer 2011.\\n\\nIn an interesting twist, Ville also joined the band as the first real drummer, and he rehearsed hard to get all the exterme parts on the album in perfect edge! We rehearsed extensively around late 2010 onwards and later on in the spring of 2012, he recorded all the live drums together with his brother Teemu, and you can hear the awesome results on the album.\\n\\nNow with all things finally ready, it was time to finalize the album for a release, and Teemu also handled the mixing duties, and we were finally able to unleash the record into the wild in April 2012.

And thus in April 2011 already, it was time to start writing new songs! The first session resulted in two songs: Corporate Machinery (Uncreation) and Three-Step Oblivion (Confined), and incidentally while Uncreation was the first song written, it ended up the last to be released, as it wound up on the 2019 EP, Impenitence. Of course, the EP was supposed to be released earlier, but other things kept us busy meanwhile.\\n\\nAfter that things picked up on the Devoid of Life front, so no more songs were written for a while. In October 2011, there was again time and during those sessions three more songs were written: Transient Line (Glitch of Creation), Mechanicide and Organic Gears (Beyond Tolerance), and these songs really solidified the direction of the upcoming album. Heavy guitars with strong electronic beats, and a futuristic ambience.\\n\\nIn early 2012, with Devoid of Life being in mixing phase by Teemu, there was plenty of time to focus on this album. So in the next 6 months, almost half of the total songs were written at a rough rate of one per month: Event Horizon (Devour the Being), Chronologic Disorder (Below Radar) and Corroded (Hindrance of Existence) gave a lot of new alternative directions for the album with many sampled drumbeats bringing another layer to the mix. And from March 2012 onwards, more songs took shape in the form of Demigenetic (Genetic Design), The Granules (Forgotten World), Mean Time To Failure (MTTF), The Observers, which were a bit more 'hammering' style songs.\\n\\nWhile there was a great bunch of songs already, it still felt like more were needed to give the album a good structure. So in the autumn of 2012, three more songs were devised: Control the Masses (Controlled), Legacy System and Flatlined. Now there was already a decent bunch! But the album felt a bit on the short side despite all the songs, so finally the last three songs were written around Feb-March 2013: Sparks of Ignition, The Origin, and a completely re-imagined remix of the Wasteland song Evolutionary Project.\\n\\nWith all songs ready, it was time to start writing the lyrics. As there was a great many songs, and also interest from Mikko, we decided to split up the lyrics duties. Much of the first half of 2013 was spent writing the lyrics, until June 2013.\\n\\nAnd finally in June 2013, we got to the recording phase! As the album is almost entirely electronic-based, it was just a matter of recording all guitars and vocals. The guitars were recorded in short order during June 2013 and all 18(!) songs were thus ready instruments-wise.\\n\\nRecording the final vocals started in August 2013 and ran until early 2014. With the vocals ready, and preliminary mixing already done with the first batches of vocals, the album was ready for release in February 2014.\\n\\n== Equipment\\n\\nGuitars\\n\\n- Schecter Blackjack 007\\n- Focusrite Saffire Pro 40\\n- Toontrack EzMix\\n\\nVocals are unfortunately unknown.","reportDate":"2025-04-05"},{"releaseCode":"VOR009","releaseTitle":"...of What Remains","report":"While Mikko was recording his vocals for The Occlusion in autumn 2013, there was a good moment to start recording some new material! This time around it was back to regular programming and the direction for ...of What Remains was clear from the start. Plenty of fast songs. At first, three songs were written and are basically how they ended up on the album. The songs were Internal Poison, Predictable End and Oceans of Steel.\\n\\nEspecially during these sessions, there was a large amount of songs demoed that never wound up being released. 13 of them in fact, some more ready, some less. One such song (Singularity) did get released on the 2019 EP, Impenitence. In total there were 20 completed demo songs for this album, which were then narrowed down to the 12 that were released.\\n\\nOnce the release of The Occlusion was ready in Feburary 2014, it was time to fully focus on this album. Half of the songs that wound up on the album were written in March-May 2014, with a clear direction in mind. The songs were written in the order: Ghosts of Existence, Strength In Numbers, Blast Radius - all in 1-3 March, and then Neolithic in late March, and Signal Loss & Disconnect in April and May. One of the reasons for dropping several of the demoed songs, as they were more along the lines of what you hear in the Impenitence EP. The songwriting progressed very smoothly and the remaining 3 songs - Decay to Static, Underutilized and Toxin Release were written in late summer 2014.\\n\\nBasically the next day after the last song was written, it was time to record the final guitars and bass. And all recording was ready in just 4 days!\\n\\nAs usual, after finishing recording all instruments, it was the moment to start writing the lyrics for the album, although there was already a lot of snippets and ideas written down through the year. The lyrics were written until early 2015, after which demo vocals were recorded to be used by Mikko as guidelines.\\n\\nIt was planned that Ville would record live drums once again, but eventually it would not be so. So we had to fall back on our trusty programmed drums. But to do something novel, instead of using just the MIDI, the final drums on the album were actually recorded on a MIDI drumpad with actual sticks. So each and every drumhit you hear was played for real, even though the sound is from a drum machine. This was done with the Alesis PercPad and playing along to the demo programmed drums, and then basically replacing each programmed hit with the human-played hit. Sounds fairly decent and real, as well it is real.\\n\\nFor the guitars, it was also a bit of a novelty as I took a classic guitar playing video of Dino Cazares' original modded Marshall, and spent a day matching up my Marshall amp sim and Mesa 4x12 impulse settings to sound as close as possible to that classic tone. And I got very close in the end! There's a short video about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8C0o-0aOIc\\n\\nMeanwhile, Mikko had started recording his vocals and the progress was smooth. Most of the vocals were ready by July 2015 and thus test mixes could begin.
