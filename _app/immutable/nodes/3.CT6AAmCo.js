  Vortech combines both fast and slow approaches to metal with futuristic scenes of industrial
  machinery working in overdrive.</p> <p>The debut album, Conclusion (2006), laid a lasting foundation in style and gained worldwide
  interest. It was quickly followed by one of the band's most popular albums, Wasteland (2007),
  which introduced hard-hitting speed into the mix and solidified the musical style that fans know
  and enjoy. A third album, Deep Beneath (2008), was released shortly after, incorporating some
  progressive elements.</p> <p>Not long after, the fourth album, Posthumanism (2009), became a hit among fans and garnered global
  attention across various platforms. At this time, the band also took to the road, performing a
  series of live shows while composing their fifth album, Devoid of Life (2012). They began to
  experiment with a new electronic approach in The Occlusion (2014), merging fast metal with an
  electrifying style, culminating in ...of What Remains (2015).</p> <p>Their latest album â€” the eighth in total - The Shadow Presence (2022) is a result of collaboration
  with fans and new guests, fusing all previous styles into a cohesive package of fast, futuristic,
  and electrified metal. With a new album nearing release in 2025, it will soon be time to enter the
