  2005, Vortech combines both fast and slow approaches to metal with the futuristic scenes of
  industrial machinery working overdrive.</p> <p>The debut album Conclusion (2006) proved to be the lasting foundation in style and gained interest
  all around the world. Quickly followed by one of the band's most popular albums, Wasteland (2007),
  bringing in some hard-hitting speed into the mix, solidified the musical style that you know and
  enjoy. A third album, Deep Beneath (2008), was published not long after, bringing in a bit of
  progressive touches.</p> <p>Not soon after, the fourth album, Posthumanism (2009), proved to be a hit among fans and garnered
  world-wide interest across platforms. At this time the band also took the show on the road and
  performed a series of live shows, all the while composing the fifth album Devoid of Life (2012)
  and planning for testing a whole new electronic approach in The Occlusion (2014), and merging the
  fast metal and extremely electric styles finally on ...of What Remains (2015).</p> <p>Currently the newest album - eighth in total - The Shadow Presence (2022) was a combination of
  cooperation with fans and new guests, fusing all the styles so far into a single tight package of
  fast, futuristic and electrified metal. And with a new album nearing release, it will soon be time
