At the moment, 14 new songs are fully demoed, with a couple of more in the works (a few ambient pieces...), but I am still aiming to write some more songs before we will begin the usual process of converting the demos into an album!

But, not to keep you in too much suspense, here are the songs so far with a short description of each. They are listed in alphabetical order:

&lt;b>Battling With A Lion&lt;/b> (160 bpm)
A futuristic re-imagination of the old demo track. Lots of ambience. Quite energetic!

&lt;b>Blast Radius&lt;/b> (225 bpm)
The song title says it all! An explosion of speed and fury, in a tightly packed powerhouse of a track. Get your industrial death metal grooves out! Just like in the mid-90's...

&lt;b>Disconnect&lt;/b> (210 bpm)
A dynamic mixture of blistering melodies and experimental verses. A view to the bitter dawn of a brave new future world. Ends with some nice synchronized madness between the kicks and guitars.

&lt;b>From the Void Arise&lt;/b> (172 bpm)
More horror-styled mood, with some melancholic dark melodies. Slightly in the style of Posthumanism, but not quite as fast.

&lt;b>Ghosts of Existence&lt;/b> (284 bpm)
Now, if you thought Frozen Machine was ridiculously fast, check this out! Perhaps humanely impossible drums (Ville?), but all the more fun! Just sheer cold and (dark)spaced out black metal - until the end. Ohh, the end will leave you hanging on the edge... Did I mention the song is 7 mins 33 seconds long?

&lt;b>Industrial Complex, Pt. 1&lt;/b> (134 bpm)
And now for something completely different! Slightly looking back to our previous album, but more befitting the mood of this album in general. Dark industrial with some twisted grooves and chugging. Back to the mid-90's, Part 2. Good times!

&lt;b>Internal Poison&lt;/b> (240 bpm)
Melodic, fast and heavy. Classic Vortech style with some of the fastest triple picks ever for the band! Trying out some new ways to play keys/synths, and very dark industrial melodies. Originally written with a keyboard!

&lt;b>Neolithic (The Darkness Is Born)&lt;/b> (175 bpm)
Another darker piece, re-constructed from two unfinished songs for the previous album. I can almost hear some Swedish influences here and there, but you will recognize it's us for sure!

&lt;b>Oceans of Steel&lt;/b> (218 bpm)
One of my supreme favourites of the demos! Extremely energetic, industrialistic and heavy! Prepare for a rainy futuristic mid-part of pure dark beauty!

&lt;b>Predictable End&lt;/b> (147 bpm)
Even more industrial metal than most. Another energetic piece of sheer catchy heaviness! Oriental industrial? Anachronism, much? Trying out some strange new drum beats, and guitarless parts.

&lt;b>Proximity&lt;/b> (137 bpm)
Industrial MotÃ¶rhead? Who knows, but this is sheer darkness in industrial metal shape. Expect some more epic synth pads, and a heavy chorus!

&lt;b>Strength In Numbers&lt;/b> (132 bpm)
Take a journey into the space industrial-complex! Very melodic, crunchy and futuristic to the bone! With some experimental synths and segues into fast parts. Quite a fun song, and very atmospheric!

&lt;b>The Empty Vessel&lt;/b> (189 bpm)
Experimenting with samples and sound FX will sometimes lead into full songs! That's the story of this little piece that brings you heavy riffs! Simple but effective piece of madness! With a very nice breakdown to bring the enjoyability to the max!

&lt;b>Within the Fog&lt;/b> (260 bpm)
Also a re-recording of an older outtake. This one from the Wasteland days! The song was ultimately unfinished and was left out of the album. Now's your chance to hear it in the modern days! Fast, traditional and with new atmospheric synths!</p></article><!--]--> <a href="/news">Back to News</a><!----><!----></main></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
