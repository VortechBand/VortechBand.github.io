Shouldn't take too long until the new 7 song EP is out. As mentioned, it is a mixture of old and new in many ways. The oldest song is from the 2006 Wasteland sessions, most of the songs are from the 2013 The Occlusion sessions, and the newest song is an outtake from the 2015 Of What Remains sessions. Two of them have brand new lyrics, and all of them have completely new drums and bass. The guitars are also all freshly recorded along with the vocals.

It's a little bit different, with a kind of more melodic style with plenty of electronics. Perhaps a bit like Conclusion. Should be out very soon!</p> <a href="/news/354-guitars-done">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">It's a wrap for bass!</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">31 May 2019</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">All bass parts have now been recorded for the Impenitence EP, which leaves just the guitars left to be recorded!

Unfortunately the schedule was too busy then, and it got postponed and postponed... until now!

The final vocals were finished just earlier today, and next up will be recording the guitars and bass for the 7 songs that will feature on the EP.  There are even 2 brand new lyrics done, and most of the songs are previously unreleased. So it will serve as a bountiful reminder of what will be :)

The tracks featured on the EP will be, in alphabetical order (the titles might change, too):

Corporate Machinery - a simple little piece of energy much in the style of The Occlusion
Devour the Being - a very different sounding melodic piece, with not much precedence in our catalogue
Genetic Structures - an incomplete song from the Wasteland sessions, which was published in our SoundCloud a few years back in the original demo form from 2006. Now finally finished!
Hindrance of Existence - another piece that was once in our SoundCloud, plenty of energy and DnB influence. Very originally it was written all the way back in 2004, now in a more energetic form.
Humanicide - this one was done as a kind of bonus song during the sessions of The Occlusion, which had this song in a more industrial form. In here, the track is in a more traditional metal form.
Singularity - a track completed just after completing the The Occlusion sessions. A high-octane industrial metal song with lots of synths
The Observers - another melodic piece, also from the 2013 sessions. A can of energy!</p> <a href="/news/352-impenitence-ep">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">While waiting for the vocals</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">11 May 2019</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">While Mikko is working on the vocals for album #8, there's a bit of a long overdue little project going on.

This time there are a couple of new tricks in the bag that should improve the sound quite a bit. Not to mention a new home studio setup, which you will be able to see soon.

But essentially final.

This time around, there is a kind of a concept to the album. A bit of an expanded version of the lyrics to Shattered Cities, but heavily fleshed out naturally. It will be the usual end of times style, but more gritty and Mad Max/Resident Evil-ish :)

The next step in terms of the lyrics is to go over them and record demo vocals to base a guideline for the final vocals. At the same time, the lyrics will be fine-tuned to form the final versions.</p> <a href="/news/327-lyricity">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Tabbing out</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">24 Apr 2018</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">As one primary step in the recording process, creating the Guitar Pro tabs for all the songs is an important step. Mostly since it records the intricacies of the riffs, leads and other parts, which is then used as a guideline in the final recording. To be sure all the little tricks in the demo songs will be recorded correctly.

And that part is now ready.

Next up will be recording the final instrumentation for the release, which is obviously one of the final stages in creating it. After that part, the last thing remaining are the vocals. And that brings the release of the next album yet closer.</p> <a href="/news/326-tabbing-out">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="30" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Website updates</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">28 Mar 2018</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">A lot of new things appear!

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuOCNCskqiQ&amp;list=PLq9Y0Jupw8lFNpuH3tWfAx2pxa9HJNPtP">FAWM 2018&lt;/a>

Keep checking until February 28 for new songs :) There will be at least 14 new songs (6 so far).

For now, most of the work is on the admin-side, like posting news and so on. But soon some user features will appear too :)

As for the recording of the next album, there is some new hardware on the way and they will certainly make an appearance on the album :) Will be exciting to see how the Kemper will change the sound style :) Hopefully all guitar and bass recordings will be ready by the end of this year!</p> <a href="/news/319-website-and-recording">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="37" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Recording of Album 8</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">18 Sep 2017</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">It has been a busy day, but there is a lot to show for it! The root of all 15 songs is now firmly in place and about half the songs have now a drum pulse, which is a nifty term to use for what I am doing for this album to bring a human groove to all things fast and slow. More on that in a video coming up later on!

So, what is next? After the drum pulses are ready, it is of course time to implement the actual drums for the songs. Then will come some bass, followed by guitars and vocals.  All the synth parts are ready now and have been exported as final versions.

There is also a very nice and cohesive concept that was conjured for this album and the story will progress along with the songs into something that ends in dust :) It is still a skeleton layout, but will receive a firm coat of steel around it in the upcoming times.

So, officially, the recording process has started! It will culminate into having everything except the actual vocals done, hopefully by the end of this year. With luck, the vocals too will be ready and we'll have a fist-inducing release done!</p> <a href="/news/318-recording-of-album-8">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="38" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The looming LEDs in the distance</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">3 Sep 2017</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">The new album is quite ready at this point. The songs have been selected and the tracklist is quite firm and kickass. Just need to finish the lyrics and fine-tune some parts, and then it's recording time! I'm sure the instruments will be ready by the end of this year, but the vocals might take a while still.﻿

Since the songs are already listenable, why not just head on and listen to the Youtube playlist with all the 15 songs :) The album versions will naturally be completely re-recorded and mixed properly (these are demo versions), and with vocals added.

Enjoy!

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1gg-FuPM1o&amp;amp;list=PLjP_hwyQP5M6vRl56OlIfM1PG0CGZ2keK">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1gg-FuPM1o&amp;amp;list=PLjP_hwyQP5M6vRl56OlIfM1PG0CGZ2keK&lt;/a>

There is a *TON* of outtake songs, and I'm sure they will appear somewhere in the future. So fear not if your favourite track is not on this particular release :)

In other news, there will soon be a new website ready to launch :) The aim is to make a lot more interactive and of course modernize it quite a lot!</p> <a href="/news/317-the-looming-leds-in-the-distance">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="39" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Soon ready to start recording</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">9 Jul 2017</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">After checking the votes and doing some additional choices, the final song list is starting to take shape! Soon it is once again time to record and prepare the lyrics. Since there is a lot of material (54 songs), there is bound to be some outtakes. Perhaps they will be included as bonus tracks or maybe an EP is formed out of them. Maybe a compilation of sorts?

The next album has no name yet, but hopefully it will be ready for release by the end of this year, or early 2018.

Meanwhile, we have now uploaded the entire album "...of What Remains" to Youtube in HD - enjoy!

And as a kind of related, some of you might know about February Album Writing Month, which is a yearly event where the goal is to write 14 songs during February. I've been taking part a few years already and here's the 14 songs from this year's FAWM - and most of the tracks are very much in Vortech style :) Perhaps we will have 2 albums coming out?

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pu8jWJv38iE?list=PLq9Y0Jupw8lGLOk7X7sE16eEm8xtVyIrk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe></p> <a href="/news/315-voting-status">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="41" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Let the system terminate the speakers!</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">17 Dec 2016</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">So it begins... we have now uploaded 24 new demo songs to a playlist you can all vote and comment on! Later next year, the top songs will be included on our 8th full length album - all songs will of course be re-recorded as usual. But enjoy the beginning of a new year to the tune of some industrial metal!

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrhevvEMxMo&amp;amp;list=PLjP_hwyQP5M5IhhvwZA5LuOVas2pShcal">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrhevvEMxMo&amp;amp;list=PLjP_hwyQP5M5IhhvwZA5LuOVas2pShcal&lt;/a>

Here's something to get started with:
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1gg-FuPM1o?list=PLjP_hwyQP5M5IhhvwZA5LuOVas2pShcal" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe></p> <a href="/news/314-let-the-system-terminate-the-speakers">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="42" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The near future, part 3</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">29 Nov 2016</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Alright, it is almost time to unleash 24 songs to battle it out. To get you in the mood, here's a third teaser video with 3 minutes of new material:

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uuZSRkNEpz8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe></p> <a href="/news/313-the-near-future-part-3">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="43" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The progress, as we know it</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">6 Nov 2016</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Alright, time flies so fast! There's a lot of progress again for the songs and at the moment there are just 4 songs left to compose guitars for! So far it's sounding really good, and some songs really elevate with the guitars added. Many songs also have some experimental lead/clean guitar stuff in the background - just enough to make it really interesting.

Getting really close to being able to start arranging the demos into structured collections of parts and transitions, also known as songs :) Then you will finally be able to hear them in full!

There will probably be one more video quite soon, where you'll hear yet some more new material!</p> <a href="/news/312-the-progress-as-we-know-it">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="44" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Future, Part 2</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">27 Sep 2016</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">After the quick peek to the future a while ago, it's already time for another! Yay!

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SW7ydWPTbIk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>

At the moment, the grand total is 24 demo songs, of which about half have demo guitars at the moment, and 6 will get an electronic treatment next.

We should soon be at the point where we can start to post demo songs for you to vote on!</p> <a href="/news/311-future-part-2">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="45" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">More future coming your way</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">2 Aug 2016</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">As mentioned in our Facebook page (&lt;a href="http://facebook.com/vortechmetal">Vortech @ FB&lt;/a>), there will be a public vote for which songs to include on the next album. The voters will of course be able to listen to all the demo songs (23 so far) and decide the favourites :) But this is a bit further into the future, once the demo songs are finished. Perhaps there will be a minipage just for this with a comment section too.</p> <a href="/news/310-more-future-coming-your-way">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="46" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">A look to the future</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">20 Jul 2016</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">The machine is ever moving forward, and you can hear some roars in this video clip:

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4na-MuNTUY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>

There is no album title yet, but there are a lot of songs done/in progress already. Some of them might be familiar from FAWM, but those tracks will be of course tweaked to suit the style. Here's the working titles in alphabetical order:

Actuator Heart
Aural Disconnect
Binary Evolution
Cybernetic Warrior
Filtered from Existence
From Biodeath to Persistence
Gothenbass
Hinge Upon Devastation
Hunter
Manipulation Gear
Photon City
Revolution Mechanism
Source Corrupt
The Cybernetics
The Evolved Ones
The Fading Humanity
The Flesh Responds
The Thought Machinery
What Makes Us Cyborgs



Yes, it's quite far in the process already! The release will probably land somewhere in early 2017 or so, depending on how the vocal recordings will go.</p> <a href="/news/309-a-look-to-the-future">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="47" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Re-void</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">16 Jun 2016</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">The brand new reissue of our 2012 album Devoid of Life is now available!

&lt;img src="contents/artwork/devoid2016-727px.jpg" alt="Devoid of Life 2016" />

This release is completely mixed again from scratch and features a modern hard-hitting and sharp mix. And also some tweaks and tricks here and there. The tracklist has also changed with Lost and Unveiling the Future switching places for a slightly more interesting flow!

Enjoy the emptiness!

UPDATE:

The drums are re-built as the originals are not available. The drums also feature some changes and they are more like the way we have been rehearsing them. Enjoy!

It marks the 10th anniversary as Vortech, and it's also the equal anniversary of our first full length!

This year will have two special releases:

1) A brand new mix of Devoid of Life, which has been requested every now and then. It is actually already done, with some small tweaks left to do, and then it will be released as a digital-only version. More news on that soon!

2) The motherlode: A "Best of" type of album consisting of &lt;b>COMPLETELY&lt;/b> re-recorded AND newly mixed songs spanning all albums, except for Devoid of Life, which will have a new mix, as mentioned above, and the newest album ...of What Remains. There will also be some minor changes to the songs here and there, based on how we have rehearsed and played live. The songs from our electronic album, The Occlusion, will be re-written as traditional songs with drums and all. The plan is to have Mikko record all the vocals, but we'll see if there's any guest vocals...

The re-recorded album has a working title of "Refactored" and the plan is to have the following songs in chronological order - the actual release will probably have them in a mixed order, almost like a new album. 

Mind Awakening
Sycophant Gods
The Core
Evolutionary Project
Instigate Hostile Reaction
Radiant Storm
Biodroid Legions
Bewildered
Xenomorphosis
Destined to Fall
The New Creations
Afterworld
Shedding the Flesh
Charcoal Earth
Mechanicide
Sparks of Ignition
Below Radar

This will be an exciting project for sure! All the songs will feature a very pristine modern production and with upgraded synth sounds etc.

And of course there's some new demo songs being done here and there for the next full length album. The album will probably be ready in 2017, though.

Meanwhile, I have been working on the test mixes and the final track order. Everything starts to fall in place and the work should be done soon!

As mentioned a few times, this album falls somewhere between Posthumanism and Wasteland in general, with of course some new tricks thrown in. Be ready for a Making Of video appearing soon with some new music included. 

And as has been the tradition, I have also started to work on some new songs for a future album - some lyrics here and there, a couple of demo songs, and some ideas collected. Come autumn, it will once again be time to start recording new demo songs!

New strings are in, and the sessions will begin in the afternoon. If all goes well, there might even be bass for all songs by the end of the day! But if not, tomorrow will be spent finishing the recordings.

The trusty BTB555, that has been featured in every album except Conclusion, will once again be used, and it should provide a nice platform for some heaviness! This time around, the basslines were composed a little bit differently - directly into the Guitar Pro tabulatures of the songs! So a slight change is expected, but overall the basslines sound really enjoyable in the tabs. It will be fun to hear them for real!

So the next step this week is to start recording some bass, and that should be a quick undertaking. Meanwhile, I will also start doing some initial editing and writing some lyrics for the songs. All the guitars are with my brand new guitar, so there will be a small change in the tone - hopefully for the better!

Once all the guitars are ready, it's time to get the bass grooves going. I expect the bass parts to be quite quick to do, as history tells us (one day for every album so far). So far the sound is bright and clean, with four rhythm guitar tracks per song. I expect all guitars to be ready today or tomorrow, and bass by the end of this week.

As with all previous albums, it will still take a while to record the drums and vocals, before the album is ready for release. However, as soon as those are recorded, the album itself should be out quite quickly.

At the moment, two songs have full final guitars, and probably two more will be completed today. After all guitars are done, then all bass parts will get their final form. So far the sound is quite good indeed, but perhaps we will do some re-amping for the guitars, since it's been a while when we last used a mic and amp combo for guitars (on Wasteland). Should be fun!</p> <a href="/news/286-currently-recording-guitars">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="70" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The things to come</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">8 Sep 2014</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">It feels now that a very strong tracklist for the next album has taken shape! The balance is quite good, with a nice split similar to how it was on Wasteland. And after a few albums' break, there's once more some ambient stuff! Personally I'm quite excited about the songs, and can't wait to have this album out!

All tabulatures have been finished for the songs, so the next step is logically to start recording! At first, as usual, I will record all guitars and bass, and then it's time for Ville to record drums and meanwhile we will write lyrics with Mikko. Once all the lyrics are ready, it's time to record the vocals!

From there on, it's the usual deal - mixing and mastering. Then it is time to release the 7th full length Vortech album!</p> <a href="/news/285-the-things-to-come">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="71" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Interview</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">6 Aug 2014</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">You can check out our interview at Robex Lundgren's blog at this address:

The total duration of all the new songs is 1h 23m of extremely Vortech-y stuff!

The next step for us is to start picking the songs for the album (10-11 total probably) and working on the song order. This time there is no central theme to the lyrics, so what we are planning to do is to split up the album in two "sides", with some ambient stuff inbetween. Then Mikko and me (Juha) will write lyrics to one side per person. Let's see what this results in!

All in all, the songs remind me a lot of the experimental edge of Wasteland, and the scifi melody and speed of Posthumanism! Very nice! Of course, with 20 songs to choose from, there will be lots of leftovers this time. We will see what happens with them - perhaps a special release of non-album tracks in digital form?

And here are the working titles of all the songs now, in alphabetical order:

Battling with a Lion
Blast Radius
Decay to Static
Disconnect
From the Void Arise
Ghosts of Existence
Industrial Complex
Internal Poison
Neolithic (The Darkness Is Born)
Oceans of Steel
Predictable End
Proximity
Quantum Dissolution
Signal Loss
Singularity
Strength In Numbers
The Empty Vessel
Toxin Release
Underutilized
Within the Fog

Stay tuned! Perhaps I will post a full demo song soon...</p> <a href="/news/282-so-it-begins">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="74" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Nearing a decade as Vortech!</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">29 Jul 2014</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">As you might know, the name of the band changed to Vortech in late 2005, and we are steadfastly closing in on a decade as such. Perhaps that will lead to some special festives, but this will be seen in the future. However, one thing is for sure. There will be more music coming at a usual pace, and here's how I foresee the next few years:

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We are soon ready with demoing the songs for the next full length album, with a working title of "...of What Remains". This album is more on the familiar style of Industrial Death Metal, like the Vortech you know best. Should all go well, this album might be out by the end of the year 2014, but it's all down to drum recording schedules. Ville will play real drums once more on the album with Mikko on vocals, and I will of course handle the other instruments. Expect an album closer to the style of Posthumanism than our previous releases.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Playing live is a target for us, and we have been rehearsing more actively this year, with a small summer break for personal reasons. We are on the lookout for opportunities to play live once more, and have a steady selection of 13 songs to pick from.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should our finances allow for it, we will certainly work on getting Posthumanism and The Occlusion released on factory pressed CDs with full casing and artwork. Another goal is to have a few more t-shirt designs available, and possibly other merchandise (feel free to drop requests on FB!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are a fellow musician, you can also send a message to us and we'll see if there's a chance for collaboration or a guest appearance on our albums! It's always fun to see how others interpret our material, so remixes and such are also more than welcome!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

So, looking forward to the next years!

- Juha / Vortech</p> <a href="/news/281-nearing-a-decade-as-vortech">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="75" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">A Whole Lotta Music</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">9 Jun 2014</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">The results of a very busy first half of the year are in! At the moment, 14 new songs are fully demoed, with a couple of more in the works (a few ambient pieces...), but I am still aiming to write some more songs before we will begin the usual process of converting the demos into an album!

But, not to keep you in too much suspense, here are the songs so far with a short description of each. They are listed in alphabetical order:

&lt;b>Battling With A Lion&lt;/b> (160 bpm)
A futuristic re-imagination of the old demo track. Lots of ambience. Quite energetic!

&lt;b>Blast Radius&lt;/b> (225 bpm)
The song title says it all! An explosion of speed and fury, in a tightly packed powerhouse of a track. Get your industrial death metal grooves out! Just like in the mid-90's...

&lt;b>Disconnect&lt;/b> (210 bpm)
A dynamic mixture of blistering melodies and experimental verses. A view to the bitter dawn of a brave new future world. Ends with some nice synchronized madness between the kicks and guitars.

&lt;b>From the Void Arise&lt;/b> (172 bpm)
More horror-styled mood, with some melancholic dark melodies. Slightly in the style of Posthumanism, but not quite as fast.

&lt;b>Ghosts of Existence&lt;/b> (284 bpm)
Now, if you thought Frozen Machine was ridiculously fast, check this out! Perhaps humanely impossible drums (Ville?), but all the more fun! Just sheer cold and (dark)spaced out black metal - until the end. Ohh, the end will leave you hanging on the edge... Did I mention the song is 7 mins 33 seconds long?

&lt;b>Industrial Complex, Pt. 1&lt;/b> (134 bpm)
And now for something completely different! Slightly looking back to our previous album, but more befitting the mood of this album in general. Dark industrial with some twisted grooves and chugging. Back to the mid-90's, Part 2. Good times!

&lt;b>Internal Poison&lt;/b> (240 bpm)
Melodic, fast and heavy. Classic Vortech style with some of the fastest triple picks ever for the band! Trying out some new ways to play keys/synths, and very dark industrial melodies. Originally written with a keyboard!

&lt;b>Neolithic (The Darkness Is Born)&lt;/b> (175 bpm)
Another darker piece, re-constructed from two unfinished songs for the previous album. I can almost hear some Swedish influences here and there, but you will recognize it's us for sure!

&lt;b>Oceans of Steel&lt;/b> (218 bpm)
One of my supreme favourites of the demos! Extremely energetic, industrialistic and heavy! Prepare for a rainy futuristic mid-part of pure dark beauty!

&lt;b>Predictable End&lt;/b> (147 bpm)
Even more industrial metal than most. Another energetic piece of sheer catchy heaviness! Oriental industrial? Anachronism, much? Trying out some strange new drum beats, and guitarless parts.

&lt;b>Proximity&lt;/b> (137 bpm)
Industrial Motörhead? Who knows, but this is sheer darkness in industrial metal shape. Expect some more epic synth pads, and a heavy chorus!

&lt;b>Strength In Numbers&lt;/b> (132 bpm)
Take a journey into the space industrial-complex! Very melodic, crunchy and futuristic to the bone! With some experimental synths and segues into fast parts. Quite a fun song, and very atmospheric!

&lt;b>The Empty Vessel&lt;/b> (189 bpm)
Experimenting with samples and sound FX will sometimes lead into full songs! That's the story of this little piece that brings you heavy riffs! Simple but effective piece of madness! With a very nice breakdown to bring the enjoyability to the max!

&lt;b>Within the Fog&lt;/b> (260 bpm)
Also a re-recording of an older outtake. This one from the Wasteland days! The song was ultimately unfinished and was left out of the album. Now's your chance to hear it in the modern days! Fast, traditional and with new atmospheric synths!</p> <a href="/news/280-a-whole-lotta-music">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="76" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">A couple of videos from our rehearsals</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">21 Apr 2014</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Here's two videos from our rehearsals in Oulu a few days ago.

The idea this time around is to make a whole lot of songs, and then select the album songs from those, to construct a cohesive and kickin' tracklist for the future world.

Just like the songs prior to these new ones, the style is quite futuristic and dynamic - you'll be sure to have a blast, hehe. Dark melodies, scifi sound effects, fast and loud guitars, blazing drums, with some new things! I'm quite excited to get this album ready for everyone to hear!

And of course we'll also be rehearsing again up north in a few weeks from now, hopefully with some new video material to show and some new promo shots perhaps?</p> <a href="/news/273-productive-and-poised">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="83" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Progression in the march of time</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">9 Mar 2014</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Now that our brand new album has been out for a month, it's time to look further into the future and unveil what lies beyond! Yes, as mentioned a while ago, we have of course been working on the next full length album, too, in addition to the Impenitence EP which should be ready later this year. To outline the plans:

Impenitence EP
- Likely out sometime in the summer
- Contains 4 unreleased songs from The Occlusion sessions
- Might contain some re-recorded older demos and unreleased tracks!

...of What Remains (working title)
- The next full length album, due late 2014 or early 2015 (at least planned)
- Will be again Industrial Death Metal with real drums
- 6 songs have been fully demoed so far (27 minutes)
- Some parts are quite extreme! Borderline black metal.
- So far sounds like a mixture of Wasteland and Posthumanism, with industrial touches

And of course, as you can see, this website has now received a spiffy little layout update and some bugfixes in the back-end code. Enjoy the new look!

So at the moment, the main effort is in writing new songs for the next full length album, and perhaps around May it's time to work on releasing the Impenitence EP.</p> <a href="/news/272-progression-in-the-march-of-time">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="84" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The Occlusion has now been released! </h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">6 Feb 2014</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">The brand new album, The Occlusion, is now released!

1. Satyricon - Satyricon
2. Skinny Puppy - Weapon
3. Rotting Christ - Κατά τον δαίμονα εαυτού
4. Dark Tranquillity - Construct
5. Witherscape - The Inheritance
6. Front Line Assembly - Echogenetic
7. Dream Theater - Dream Theater
8. Amorphis - Circle
9. James Labrie - Impermanent Resonance
10. Funker Vogt - Companion In Crime

Are they an indication for the upcoming releases of Vortech? Hard to say, but in any case, they will prove to be a good listen!

We just finished an extensive rehearsal period with the band, and altogether we played probably 6 - 7 hours total. Everything's grooving nicely, and we are thinking of doing a live performance in 2014 - finally!

Mikko is just about ready with all the vocals, so soon it's time to release the new releases, too! It's been a slightly longer schedule than I had hoped for, but it's better to be meticulous for the style the new releases represent...</p> <a href="/news/269-so-what-inspired-this-year">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="87" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">End of the year sales! </h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">29 Nov 2013</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">To wrap up the year, we now have up to 30 % discounts on all merchandise at our BandCamp store!

Hopefully we can soon hear the end results of the efforts. Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, I've been writing new songs - in the more familiar industrial death metal style - and there's already four fully finished demo tracks (of the five mentioned in the 24 October post). These sound very good and should bring a smile to any fan! I will continue working on more songs in the next few months, and perhaps there will be a release sooner than expected, since there is already more than 15 minutes of material ready, hehe.</p> <a href="/news/267-vocal-recordings-and-new-songs">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="89" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The future is here (revisited)</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">24 Oct 2013</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">While Mikko continues the vocal recording sessions for the upcoming releases (The Occlusion + Impenitence EP), I am quite busy writing new material for the next release. This album seems to be heading into a more orchestral(ish) direction so far, with plenty of fast drums and guitars. Slightly like a combination of the industrial atmosphere of Posthumanism and the relentless speed of Frozen Machine. All the while trying some new things too!

In the excitement of writing, there's actually four almost finished demo songs, with a 5th one in progress! It seems to be an inspirational time of year, hehe. I'm also testing out some more intricate drum lines, taking inspiration from Deep Beneath drumming. This one will be out sometime in the second half of 2014.

Given the nature of the songs, it should prove to be a quick endeavour! Hang tight and check our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VortechMetal">Twitter&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/vortechmetal">Facebook&lt;/a>, or this website to catch the latest news!

Altogether there are 18 songs to be recorded, of which 14 will be on the album and the remaining four will be on an EP. Both will be released around the same time, so you'll have a nice year with Vortech! The release date depends on how quickly we can conclude the recording and finish the mixing, but usually they have not taken too long...

Stay tuned for more info about the album name and titles.</p> <a href="/news/256-it-is-time-to-start-recording-the-album">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="100" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Demo vocals in progress</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">4 Jun 2013</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">So far four songs have fully completed demo vocals done. That leaves 10 songs left to do for me, and 4 songs for Mikko. The 4 songs are the songs Mikko wrote lyrics for. Should be interesting to hear what he came up with! Tomorrow I will continue recording more demo vocals, with hopefully 5 more songs receiving the demo effect :P</p> <a href="/news/255-demo-vocals-in-progress">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="101" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Tabs done! Commence demo vocals...</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">2 Jun 2013</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">All the guitar tablatures have now been completed! 18 songs in an easy format to learn from! So, that leads the way to recording the demo vocals, which will serve as a guideline for the final vocals. Once they are done, I will begin recording the final guitars for the new album!</p> <a href="/news/254-tabs-done-commence-demo-vocals">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="102" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Finalizing phase before recording starts</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">22 May 2013</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">One song left to do lyrics for! Overall, the lyrics are mixture of something familiar and something abstract. You should find them very nice and cozy to paint a dystopian mental picture with, hehe. This time around, the themes are centered slightly further in the future, where things are different in many ways. Neon lights reflecting from pouring rain puddles on sleek steel, destroyed in long-past conflicts.

I have also started working on the Guitar Pro tabs for the songs, so all you guitar slingers can have a go at the songs! Perhaps I will do some instruction videos too. As the songs have quite a bit of new tricks, in terms of Vortech, there should be some nice revelations to be found when checking the tabs! Look forward to the tabs on our updated website, published with the release of the album!

Anyway, the next point on the schedule is recording the demo vocals. A very important thing to do, as you would expect. After doing the demos, we will check how the lyrics work with the phrasing and such, and if something needs to be adjusted before recording the real vocals. Once the demo vocals are done, it is time to begin recording album number 6...</p> <a href="/news/253-finalizing-phase-before-recording-starts">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="103" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Lyrics soon done!</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">14 May 2013</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Just some finalization left to do, and then the lyrics are finally done for the next release!</p> <a href="/news/252-lyrics-soon-done">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="104" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Fulltime lyrics generation</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">11 Apr 2013</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">The lyrics for the next album are well underway, with about 70% of them ready for demo vocals!

The method I use this time is to pick a song that starts the album, and then find which song works the best following the previous song. If there are multiple very good followers, I fork the list. Then I'll just listen which of the lists works the best.</p> <a href="/news/249-forking-a-maze-in">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="107" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The Electronic Front!</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">9 Mar 2013</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">We are now ready with writing new songs for the next Vortech album! Altogether, there's 18 new songs, clocking in at 1 hour 11 minutes 50 seconds! As mentioned, this album is highly electronic/industrial-oriented in the approach and expands the palette of Vortech to whole new levels!

I've always likened the style of Vortech as a triangle where each corner has one of the three aspects: 1) Extreme Metal, 2) Industrial and Electronic, and 3) Progressive. Looking back, Deep Beneath leaned a lot towards the Progressive corner, while for example Posthumanism was in the Extreme corner along with Wasteland. This brand new album will be a case where the flag is hoisted firmly in the Industrial and Electronic corner.

We will also work on a second album this year, which will be in the more familiar Vortech grounds of Industrial Death Metal. But at the moment, the full effort is given for this electronic metal album, which has the working title "The Binary Hive". We will now begin to go through the songs to pick a suitable tracklist and do any adjustments to the songs if needed. The lyrics will also be written during this time, and once everythings ready, we will start to record the album!

That's it for the mean time!

And the second album will be started as soon as there's time. The second album will be back to the familiar Vortech-ground of extreme metal infused with an industrial edge! If all goes well, look forward to the end of the year for the first tasters! If not even the finished thing :)

1) The new electronic metal album will have a couple of more demo songs done before it's time to start reviewing the material and choosing what songs will be on it. Recording it will be quite quick after that, since there's only guitars and vocals that need to be recorded live.

2) The CD prints for Devoid of Life and Posthumanism. I just need to finish the preparation of the artwork and gather the funds for it, then I will send quote requests and then they should be ready within this year - depending on funds mostly. They will be printed CDs, instead of factory-made CD-R discs.

3) The T-shirts for Devoid of Life will be ordered as soon as I get replies to the quote requests, and then we will decide which company we will use. The shirts should be quickly available after that, and they will be available for purchase through our website and hopefully some other places.

4) Live shows and rehearsals. We will continue our rehearsals at least until we have a nice setlist working well, and then we will start looking forward to playing some concerts around Finland, and hopefully soon abroad too!

5) The next Vortech band album. Of course being planned already! I already have some ideas for the style and such, and I'm sure many will be pleased to know it will be a really fast one, hehe. Scifi and all... For sure it will be ready by the end of 2013, but who knows maybe even earlier.

6) We are also trying out some extra members for the band, although currently perhaps just for live shows. We'll see how things work out, and maybe we will have some full-time additions!

7) Also some updates for the website will come in the near future, addressing some things that could work a bit differently, plus adding some more things!

I guess that should cover most things for the time being :)</p> <a href="/news/228-current-plans">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="128" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Picturesque</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">12 Aug 2012</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">We also have a new promo picture available in the Downloads section, and also below:

Here's pretty much all video material there is from the sessions. The material is from summer 2010, from the main guitar recording sessions. Only a couple of extra leads were recorded later. Unfortunately there is no material from the bass, drum and vocal recordings. Enjoy seeing the riffs in pure form, hehe ;)

There should also be some more social elements added and the guestbook will receive an update to allow unicode characters. The biography and such will also be updated to reflect the current status.

The basic structure is already done, and now the eyes turn toward creating the content. There will be some extensive PHP additions, to make many things more handy, so it might take some time for them to be added. I will see later whether I will update the important content, and then add more things to the site as they become ready.

But tune in later to see the new site! Hopefully by the end of this week.

Meanwhile, I'm having a lot of more ideas for the next songs, and even the next-next album (2013? Maybe sooner). And the idea is that it will feature real drums! Yep, Ville will most likely take over the duties of a drum-human(?). So it will be with great anticipation we look forward with!

But to sum it up:

Late 2011(-ish): the current album, entitled Devoid of Life
Mid 2012: the electronic album
Sometime 2013: the album with human drums</p> <a href="/news/205-hold-your-horses">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="151" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Eerie silence... ends!</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">15 Jul 2011</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">I was happy to hear that Matti will resume work on the vocals in a brand new studio built in hte premises of his other band. The latest progress report is that we should have the new album out in September! Let's hope things go well, and finally you can hear the new album in its entirety!

But even more twisted, heheh. Can't wait to have this released, it should prove to be a nice addition to the category of rare genres of music :)</p> <a href="/news/203-progress-on-the-2012-album-composing">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="153" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Songwriting...</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">2 Apr 2011</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">While waiting for the vocals for the upcoming album to be finished, I have already started to write songs for the album after the upcoming one, hehe. But hold your horses, the album I just started to write songs for is probably released sometime in 2012.

You're probably curious what the 2012 album will sound like. Well, from the first songs and rough material, it is very different to Posthumanism and the 2011 album. Much more electronic and more ambient in general, but still with lots of guitars ;) We think three albums of blastbeats should do for the time being, so don't expect a lot (if any) of them on the 2012 album. The style is more futuristic, beat-oriented with industrial ambience.

It's all very inspiring at the moment, so the 2012 album should progress well in the upcoming months :)</p> <a href="/news/202-songwriting">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="154" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Two songs mixed</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">27 Feb 2011</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Slowly but surely it's coming together!

Taking a while, but for the best :)

And of course, at this point I've already been looking forward, and the album after the upcoming one will be slightly different than the past two albums. But let's see how the final direction is like! I'm sure it will be more electronic overall.</p> <a href="/news/201-two-songs-mixed">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="155" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">First vocals received</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">20 Jan 2011</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">I just received the first batch of vocals from Matti and I'll start to work on the mix very soon :) Once the process is well underway, there will probably be some clips for all to hear :) Despite all the hardware breakdowns, I'm sure this album will be out well before summer :)</p> <a href="/news/200-first-vocals-received">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="156" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Post-posthumanism</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">4 Jan 2011</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">The album Posthumanism has now been downloaded over 2000 times through our website! :) And Deep Beneath is not too far behind.

I chose to make my vocals in my most natural rough voice, which I find quite similar to Tomas Lindberg (At the Gates). Then there's some clean vocals that I recorded, but I will listen to them for a few days and decide if they're publishable or if I'll get someone else to sing them :)

But anyway, if they're good, I will release the EP in a few days. And as a reminder, the EP will be quite different from the style of the main album!

They're still great songs, so hence the extra EP ;) And as just a high-five to some long-term fans, and new ones too, here's a teaser clip on how one of those songs on the EP sounds like! Enjoy ;)

Yes, the elusive Making of Posthumanism video! I'm currently uploading it to Youtube, so expect a link very soon :) 7,5 minutes of tight information! 

Here you go!

And that leaves just the vocals to be recorded, and then to import them in. The album will finish on the fly along with the vocals, so it might be quick!

And also, I just finished making the first draft for the album artwork, so things are slowly falling into place for the release! Hopefully I will be able to make a professional CD-R release for both the new album, plus Posthumanism.</p> <a href="/news/187-some-more-progress">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="169" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Vocals &amp; Other</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">3 Oct 2010</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Matti has requested some more time to rehearse the vocals for the album, so the recording has been postponed for a while. So, meanwhile that will give me the opportunity to continue on the second little thing I've planned for the 10th anniversary of Vortech. It will be an album not like the normal anniversary compilation or re-recording, but something quite different indeed!

What it is, is a complete reworking of many Vortech songs released so far. I have first chosen a selection of 16 tracks from the history of Vortech, and then I have decided a completely different music genre that I will use as a guideline for the remaking of each song :) In every case, completely different than what the original was. 

Once this special release is ready, you will hear, for example, a black metal version of Apoapsis Mentis, a lounge/orchestral version of Humanity: Static, a dubstep/industrial version of Evolutionary Project, a jazz version of Terra Ultimatum, drum &amp; bass version of The Core, a dark ambient version of Biodroid Legions, and many many more equally interesting remakes! And maybe a few surprises too...

And as a final bonus, here is a quick sneak preview on what is to come! ;) Enjoy!

4 hours and 50 minutes to record all the bass guitars for the new album, plus bounce the tracks... not bad ;)

Once the bass is finished, I will also bounce the guitar and bass tracks, so that the song is ready for vocal recording and subsequent mixing. Each song will once again be listed below and I will check them once they're finished.

As for vocals, I still don't have much in the way of lyrics - only one sketch of full lyrics for The Black Rite, and some lines here and there for the others. Matti has some lyrics for a few songs, so there's still a few more to finish. Once all the bass tracks are recorded and the songs prepared, I will start to concentrate on the lyrics. The idea is forming quite well for the theme of the album, but more on that later... meanwhile:

So that's what I've been doing now. I finished adjusting the intonation, truss rod and tuning earlier today, and a while ago I picked the guitar tone for the album. The whole chain seems to be: Gtr -> Redeye -> Fireface 400 -> Poulin LeGion (VST preamp) -> Poulin LeCab -> DSS3 Mesa 4x12 impulses

It's sounding monster and very tight, which should fit the album too ;) And not to leave you hanging, here's also a video from the tone sessions. Of course, you can't tell much from that, but at least you'll see how I did the picking and comparing. Have fun!

With the four songs dropped in favour of intensity, there might be a separate EP that features those four non-album tracks, since they're still quite good songs too.

So far the album is looking to be like this:

1. The Black Rite (4:13)
2. Neurovirus (3:21)
3. Unveiling the Future (3:42)
4. Shattered Cities (3:57)
5. Frozen Machine (4:02)
6. Lost (3:58)
7. Wire Synapse (3:58)
8. The Apocalypse (5:15)
9. Grains of Reality (5:44)

I will also post some pictures and progress reports of the session, so keep checking here once in a while this and next week!

In total, 13 songs will be recorded, but two of them will not be on the album. The usual case of not fitting in with the structure.

Thrash riffage with a build-up for the chaotic chorus. I think I once described the song as Arcturus goes Testament.

&lt;b>Charcoal Earth&lt;/b>
Energetic opening, with a melancholic verse slightly in Need for Speed II soundtrack style. End-time song and mood.

&lt;b>Demon In the Circuitry&lt;/b>
The first song that was finished. Quite dark and driving, with an uplifting slightly egyptian chorus. A hard-hitting electronic interlude.

&lt;b>Frozen Machine&lt;/b>
High-speed black metal with lots of electronics. You can hear the demo version on our &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">Myspace&lt;/a> page. Maybe even slightly orchestral, but highly dark in the chorus.

&lt;b>Grains of Reality&lt;/b>
Dark electro. Slightly ambient but very expressive. Ulver? Even darker. Will most likely be the album ending song.

&lt;b>Lost&lt;/b>
Some more black metal, this time a bit more straightforward. Still some dark melodies and a bit of speed. The kick drums really take advantage of being a machine ;) Something like 364 bpm...

&lt;b>Neurovirus&lt;/b>
The first song to be played live from the album. Kind of Meshuggah-ish. Electronics, low tuning and some tricks. A really fun song.

&lt;b>Pyre of Souls&lt;/b>
Perhaps a small homage to mid-90's Waltari. It's actually made out of riffs that didn't fit the past two albums, but still sounded good. This time they did, when combined. Get your butt movin' and groovin'!

&lt;b>Shattered Cities&lt;/b>
Very industrial, with sample-based drums and electro beats. Quite dark overall, part of this song was going to be in a fully drum &amp; bass type of song. Eventually the song developed into this one. New Breed?

&lt;b>The Apocalypse&lt;/b>
Very slow doom metal with synths and a piano. Haunting and eerie with a highly fitting title. Perhaps the last song on the album. 

&lt;b>The Black Rite&lt;/b>
Probably the album opening song. High-paced and energetic, with a nice mood. Very melodic chorus, with sudden black metal changes.

&lt;b>Unveiling the Future&lt;/b>
Punk/Hardcore? With a slight blackish touch, â­¡ Zyklon, but really something I haven't heard before anywhere. No blastbeats! ;)

&lt;b>Wire Synapse&lt;/b>
Slightly fast with more hardcore things and electronics. Maybe a little SYL-like chorus, but darker. A lot of space synths in Darkspace style.


Will the album be called "Devoid of Life", time will tell ;) The artwork has progressed well. Once all the changes are complete to the demo songs, it's time to select which songs will be on the album. Not all of them will be.</p> <a href="/news/166-song-by-song-for-the-next-album">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="190" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Album #5</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">1 May 2010</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">I'm sure you've been anxious for some news about it :) And this is the latest: I just finished demoing the last of the songs for the release!

Enjoy ;)</p> <a href="/news/153-new-song-available">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="203" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Progress towards album #5</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">18 Nov 2009</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Just like I did one for the past couple of albums, here's a quick run through the so far completed demo tracks, how they sound etc. Again, the song titles may not be final, as they will be named after the lyrics have been finished. Okay, let's see. These are in alphabetical order:

&lt;b>Chaos Dimension&lt;/b>
A bit slower (in Vortech scale :D) with lots of melody and synths, but the chorus goes down a dark path towards (you guessed it!), chaos feel in the first two appearances of the chorus, with a nice lead line replacing the grand piano in the remaining choruses. Imagine opening a door and stepping out to a thunderstorm.

&lt;b>Charcoal Earth&lt;/b>
The quick intro leads you right into a melodic black metal kind of chorus, followed by a melancholic verse part where the synths take the stage. Soon the mood goes towards darkness... I think the verse has a lot of Need for Speed II/III intro music feel. A bit more experimental in the later parts of the song. Overall somewhat lush, but uneasy in mood.

&lt;b>Demon In the Circuitry&lt;/b>
The first song written for the upcoming album. Starts with some tentative blasting, leading into a mysterious verse. The chorus lets it loose, leading back to a Millennium era FLA-like dark thingy. On the second time, the chorus gets a nice lead addition, much in Deep Beneath spirit. Then it's time to stop and hammer down an intense breakdown with lots of processed synth.

&lt;b>Frozen Machine&lt;/b>
The most extreme song I've done for Vortech. All out black metal at 262 bpm with lots of mountain-high orchestral synths, ridiculous shredding rhythms and a desperate lead guitar line. And back to some more fireworks and leads. And some more muscular blasting :P A brief slow part, picking up the pace in no time, leading into the snowstorm of a chorus. Think of Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, taking place in the future...

&lt;b>Neurovirus&lt;/b>
The future is grim indeed, in a bit more thrash-like song, with a nice twist. Fear Factory goes Meshuggah? A bit eastern in the chorus, followed by a melodic post-chorus. Then it's blast-time, and back to some tricksy palm mutes.

&lt;b>Pyre of Souls&lt;/b>
Now this is an interesting piece. And yes, this song was written before Devin released Addicted! :) An upbeat, very industrial metal song in pure mid-90's Waltari style, but with some twisted melodies. This song is actually compiled of some excellent outtake riffs from the Posthumanism sessions, that didn't fit into the other songs, but sounded great on their own. Get your ass shakin' :D

&lt;b>The Apocalypse&lt;/b>
What else would a song with a title like that be? Blastbeat and shr... well, actually it's a doom metal song :D From 262 bpm down to 80 bpm! Very slow and haunting, with more synths than your average doom song, but that's what experimentation is about ;) Think of H.P. Lovecraft in song form. Very eerie, mysterious and dark. Quite a different style than the other songs, and it's possibly the album ending song.

&lt;b>The Black Rite&lt;/b>
A monster of a chorus! Very epic and grand, plus heavy of course. Somewhat more in the progressive vein of Deep Beneath, but with more synths and devilish melodies. One of my favourite songs of these eight, and will end up in our live set for sure. It already sounds like an excellent song to end a show with!


So there you go, a quick description of the songs finished so far. I will keep writing songs until new year or so, including some ambient stuff again, and there's also a few unfinished songs left to complete. Overall, I think there will be 15 songs from which I will select the final 10-11 songs for the album. Should be a nice continuation to the Vortech timeline! No idea of when it will be finished, but more than likely it will be spring 2010 or so, as usual ;)</p> <a href="/news/152-progress-towards-album-5">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="204" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Website back!</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">17 Nov 2009</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Our webhost screwed up the domain update and that's why you saw the ad page for a while.

Still working on the new songs, and the newest piece is a really slow apocalyptic vision of doom (ooh, where did I hear that?). It sounds really cool and different :) It may become the album closing song. And as I keep on listening to the 5 fully finished tracks, they feel more and more kickass!

We'll still play there, but the second band will be selected later.

Oh and slightly related, I will be doing a solo cover gig at a school May Day afterparty, playing an hour's worth of party music. There will be songs from Pain, Clawfinger, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie and so on :) If you're around in Kemi, come see the show! The venue is still unclear, but I'll update once I know it.

Update:
The venue is Hullu Pohjola and the show starts at around 23:59 on 30 April.

Update #2:
Okay, due to a small miscommunication, there will be an ad for the show stating that Vortech will play there. It's not Vortech and there won't be Vortech songs (unless the audience really wants to hear some more :P). The official name of the one-off show band is Boylestad Slam (inside humour).</p> <a href="/news/123-live-updates">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="233" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Reaching the limits</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">21 Apr 2009</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Alright, looks like there was so much demand for the older albums (too) that we've almost reached the monthly transfer limits and I'm not sure what the provider does when you exceed it: either they close the site for the month, or it will become very slow.

Oh yeah, and there's been a small switch with vocal mics, since Mikko (Relativity) managed to somehow break Tero's SM57 (!) after the first recording sessions.

I've also been asked about Vortech shirts. It depends on how well the new album fares: the more interest there is, the faster I can have the shirts available ;) I hope to have shirts for sale by 12 June, when we have a gig in Oulu.

And as usual, here's my Top 10 albums for the year. If you haven't heard these, give 'em a listen. Really nice stuff, at least for me:

01. Opeth - Watershed
02. Darkspace - Dark Space III
03. The Amenta - n0n
04. Amon Amarth - Twilight of the Thunder God
05. Scar Symmetry - Holographic Universe
06. Gojira - The Way of All Flesh
07. Arcana - Raspail
08. Black Comedy - Instigator
09. Misery Index - Traitors
10. Qntal - Translucida

And as for gigs, I've got a few threads running and we'll see how they work out. There's also going to be a gig at a festival in Liminka, and they're threatening to make us the headliner ;) Should be fun then.

From now on you can only get digital music at their store. And for some reason FLAC has stopped working there.

There's 11 songs in total, clocking in at about 48 minutes in length. The premise (and sound) is quite futuristic, but I need to finish the lyrics before I can tell more about the story.

This baby is a lot faster than Deep Beneath, and colder in that Demanufacture or Tonight's Decision way. The sound is more space-y with often multilayered melodies.

I'll upload it in a few hours, but the domain won't probably be fixed until tomorrow.

And in other news, I think I'm done writing songs for the next album. There's 11 finished songs at 48:20 and two incomplete ones that I need to arrange + one extra electronic/industrial one that may also be our intro tape at live shows. So it should be interesting. The songs are quite a bit faster and more melodic compared to Deep Beneath, and I think the vocals will also have more variety, since Matti has been learning some new stuff.

Anyway, I think I'll start recording the songs near the end of this year and then start working on the lyrics as usual. Then it's time to record the vocals, probably in February or March 2009, and from there on it takes some time to finish the mix and then do a CD print.

I've finished almost all the backing tracks (drums, electronics, etc). All live drums use the same Superior Drummer 2.0 kit, so that there's the same drum sound for all songs from each album. And at that, I also re-composed a lot of the drumming from Conclusion and Wasteland. The drums still play mostly the same base beats, but with different fills and such, and sometimes different beats altogether. A lot of the songs have new synths added too, and in a few cases there's all new synth work in the songs that didn't have any on the album (Their Contract and Winds of Contamination, most prominently). So, you'll hear much new stuff in the live renditions of the songs :)

I still need to finish a few more songs, though, but it shouldn't take long. The next step is rehearsing all the songs with Matti, and hopefully we can start the rehearsals this weekend. Once we can nail most of the songs, we can start looking for gigs :)</p> <a href="/news/81-it-s-a-live-one-soon">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="275" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Another review + more</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">3 Sep 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">&lt;a href="http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&amp;sid=6&amp;id=14879">http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&amp;sid=6&amp;id=14879&lt;/a>

There's another decent review. There's more to come still, and reviews should be appearing in some magazines too, so hopefully there'll be more and more exposure :)

&lt;b>Update, 4 September:&lt;/b>
Another review has been published, over at Stalker Music (in Finnish):
&lt;a href="http://www.stalkermusic.com/index.shtml?call=review&amp;id=324">http://www.stalkermusic.com/index.shtml?call=review&amp;id=324&lt;/a>

A very nice review mostly, with only some minor nitpicks here and there about the music. Apparently the Wasteland review is coming soon too.</p> <a href="/news/80-another-review-more">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="276" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">New demo song now streaming</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">28 Aug 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Go on to our Myspace page: &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal&lt;/a> to listen to a brand new demo song in full! The song is instrumental at the moment, but there will be vocals on the album version.

Oh and I've decided to take up on describing the genre of Vortech as Cybertech, since it gets a bit old saying "Industrial black/death progressive metal" :) That name should concisely tell what the music is all about.</p> <a href="/news/79-new-demo-song-now-streaming">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="277" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Progress towards album #4</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">28 Aug 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Well, I just finished two more demo songs, which brings the grand total to 8 finished demo songs clocking in at just under 35 minutes. I'll keep writing more songs until the end of October, or early November. Then I'll start going through the songs and picking which ones will be on the album and doing any changes needed to the other songs. After that I'll start working on the lyrics, which should be done around early December or so, hopefully. In January, it's once again time to start recording the final songs. The vocal recording sessions should be fun with mobile equipment now at my disposal.

Here's some quick run-throughs of the songs so far, in alphabetical order with working titles for songs, the final names will be decided after the lyrics are done:

&lt;b>Afterworld&lt;/b> (3:54) [234 bpm]
Quite a fast song that starts out with a deceiving melody before lashing out. The first chorus is quite an evil sounding one, followed by a very old school Swedish death metal style main chorus.

&lt;b>Astral Breed&lt;/b> (3:58) [145 bpm]
A midtempo song with a mysterious main verse. The second part takes up the first space shuttle available. The chorus is a very sneaky one combining trance with a black metalish slower guitarline.

&lt;b>Bleak Expectations&lt;/b> (4:52) [220 bpm]
Starts out with some synth work, followed by some technical riffage with more black metal touches. The chorus is very melodic with lots of synth stuff and arpeggios. The C part contains black metal and more space-synths, with a nice solo spot later on.

&lt;b>Humanity: Static&lt;/b> (5:41) [156 bpm]
Very driving song all around, with lots of electronics and synths. A nice mystical and evil sounding chorus. Could be the album opener.

&lt;b>Posthumanism&lt;/b> (3:54) [256 bpm]
Extremely fast stuff, with a nice twisted melody-riddled chorus and lots of time signature changes. Very futuristic sound. Another candidate for an album opener.

&lt;b>The Wolves&lt;/b> (4:39) [157 bpm]
Starts out with an oriental style shredfest, followed by a futuristic setting going towards a very electronic chorus. Lots of heavy riffs.

&lt;b>Transcendence&lt;/b> (3:31) [157 bpm]
The first song composed after Deep Beneath. Nice and futuristic with a nice drive. The chorus may get a small change, but at the moment it's got a nice melody going on. The C-part features completely over the top drum machine work.

&lt;b>Xenomorphosis&lt;/b> (4:17) [244 bpm]
Fast stuff with a very futuristic feeling, fans of the original Need for Speed soundtrack will feel at home, especially during the chorus. Relentless song.

&lt;a href="http://imperiumi.net/alb_2.php?id=7980">http://imperiumi.net/alb_2.php?id=7980&lt;/a> - Wasteland, 7/10

Not bad scores at all, since the same guy gave 8Ý¯10 to Darkspace's III, which is one of the best albums of this year :) In short, the reviewer liked everything except the drum machine.

&lt;img src="img/letters.jpg" alt="Promo albums" />

And finally, as some of you may have noticed on Last.fm, I've got six songs demoed for the next Vortech album. This time I've been doing a mixture of speed and electronics, which should provide more listening pleasure ;) The working titles for the songs are: Afterworld, Humanity:Static, Posthumanism, The Wolves, Transcendence and Xenomorphosis.

Unfortunately the super jewelbox was a bit too expensive, so I decided to go with the regular jewelbox instead. Anyways, there will be 100 pcs of both Wasteland and Deep Beneath available, and 50 pcs of Conclusion.

And as a special bonus for CD orders, there are two bonus tracks on Deep Beneath (instrumental original demo versions of Biodroid Legions and Retribution), plus the making of... video for the album, which you can watch at Youtube too in lower quality.

I will start taking orders once the CDs arrive, which shouldn't take too long anymore. If all goes well, they'll be available on Friday the 13th (oooh) of June. Each CD will cost 12 euros (18 USD) + shipping: 3 euros in Europe, 4 euros (6 USD) for the rest of the world. If you order more CDs, the shipping will be cheaper per CD.

The t-shirts will be available later this month.

&lt;b>Update, 10 June 2008:&lt;/b>
Looks like payments from outside the EU area would be problematic (expensive). I'll try looking into other options, so that fans living outside the EU area can also buy the albums. There's a distributor possibility, which would also make PayPal a possible payment method. The problem is that it would make the CDs a little bit more expensive, but if you order several CDs at once, after the shipping costs they will cost less.</p> <a href="/news/73-cd-news">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="283" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">May update</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">6 May 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Deep Beneath has been downloaded 430 times, and Wasteland is soon at 400!

I'll also start working on some new material around that time. I don't know how the material will turn out, but I have a feeling it will be quite fast with a lot more keyboards and synths now with a MIDI keyboard available.</p> <a href="/news/72-may-update">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="284" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Making of Deep Beneath</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">5 Apr 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Here you have the full Making of Deep Beneath video set at Youtube.

It is now quite certain that they will be available this summer and there will also be a Vortech t-shirt available. Depending on how well the shirt sells, there may also be a second type of t-shirt later on for diversity.

During this time, I've been preparing all the background tracks for most of the songs from the three latest albums for possible live gigs this fall/winter. But first we need to rehearse the songs with Kraken during the summer and also see if it's feasible to perform with just two guys. If there's gigs, they will most likely be in this area (Tornio-Kemi-Oulu, maybe Rovaniemi) and perhaps in Sweden (Haparanda, Luleå¡¡nd maybe Umeå©® I will also try to record those gigs and see how it works. Maybe put out a live album for fun, or just have them available for download. We'll see.

I'll also start composing for the next Vortech album this summer, as usual, and aim for a release in the first quarter of 2009. So far there's just some material I came up with during the DB sessions and some other things, but nothing full yet.</p> <a href="/news/70-downloads-and-updates">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="286" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The new album has been released!</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">6 Mar 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Today marks the release of Deep Beneath, the latest installment of the Vortech saga.

As for the guitars, I decided the scrub the reamped tracks and just go with impulses and EQ spectrums for the final tone. The reamped tracks sounded nice on their own and all, but they didn't fit very well into the mix, so it was a nice test but better left for some more practice. Anyways, this weekend and during next week, we'll be recording Kraken's vocals for the album over at the Siwa Studios. I already recorded two vocal tracks of my own last friday, but we'll see if I'll use them on the album.

Right now I need some sleep after sitting in one place for 3 hours pushing space and clicking record :)

I've got a whole bunch of pictures and videos from the session, which I will add to the "Making of" video for Deep Beneath.

I'll try all sorts of things for the guitars and see what turns out the best. Once I'm happy with the guitar sound, I'll reamp all of them in one go and I'm also going to record some vocals too. That leaves just the guest vocalists' parts left to record and then I can start mixing the CD!</p> <a href="/news/61-today-s-the-big-day">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="295" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Future Plans</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">15 Feb 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">I've been going through some things and doing some research this week and the aim is to do a small pressing of all three full length Vortech albums: Conclusion (2006), Wasteland (2007) and Deep Beneath (2008). The print would 50 pcs of each album, and also 50 pcs of Vortech t-shirts. If all goes well, this will happen this summer, most likely in July or so, and you will be able to buy the CDs and the t-shirt (10xSmall, 20xMedium, 10xLarge, 10xExtra Large) through this website. From there on, if there is more demand for the CDs and t-shirts, I will order another pressing. But initially it will be a 50 pcs pressing of each.

There may be another distributor too, but it depends on other issues. I will be able to ship them all around the world, but most likely the only payment method would be a bank transfer. If the other distributing system works out, there will also be credit card and PayPal options, but just for CDs.

I haven't decided on the prices yet (it depends on how much the print will cost), but most likely they will be around 10 - 14 euros for a CD, and 15 - 20 euros for the t-shirts. But that is just an estimate.

Stay tuned for more updates on the Deep Beneath recording process, which resumes next weekend with guitar reamping and vocal recording!</p> <a href="/news/60-future-plans">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="296" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Vocal recording</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">10 Feb 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">The recording session has been postponed because Tero isn't in town next weekend, so I can't record them yet.

Next up I'll do demo vocals for all the songs so that Kraken can learn how they go. Then he can start recording, or actually I can start recording since we can record the vocals over at the Relativity rehearsal space. Not this weekend since he doesn't have time to learn the songs and not next weekend since I'll be touring in Sweden with Relativity, but the next weekend (15 - 17 February) after that we should be able to start recording.</p> <a href="/news/58-a-week-my-ass">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="298" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The next phase begins</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">23 Jan 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">Alright, I just finished tabbing the songs too, so now I have both lyrics and tabs for all the songs. That means that I'll begin recording DI guitars and bass soon, and that process will probably take a week or two. I've made preliminary arrangements with Kraken and he'll probably do vocals on a lot of the songs once again. Right now I'll go through the lyrics once more and decide the final titles for the songs.

Here's the final tracklist and song titles:

01. The Awakening &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> | &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span>
02. Biodroid Legions &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> | &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span>
03. The Undying Storm &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> | &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span>
04. Shadow Shapes &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> | &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span>
05. Retribution &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> | &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span>
06. Bewildered &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> | &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span>
07. Deep Beneath
08. Subjugation &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> | &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span>
09. Exile Within &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> | &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span>
10. So They Rise &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> | &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span>

Songs with a green &lt;span style="color: lime">GDI&lt;/span> and &lt;span style="color: lime">BDI&lt;/span> in them indicate that I've finished recording the final DI tracks for them; GDI = Guitar DI, BDI = Bass DI. 

If all goes well, the album should be out sometime March 2008. But if everything goes extremely well, it might be out a lot sooner.

Here's a quick video of what's to come (from Biodroid Legions):

The tracklist and song titles aren't 100% final, there may be changes to both. But it's currently my choice between the various song orders I've tested:

Here's how: I've already been fiddling around with two new tracks for the next album after the upcoming one :D Just received my new midi keyboard today, so now I can truly compose some nice midi stuff to the songs. The two songs so far seem to be a bit more keyboard oriented, so it might bring a nice change for the usual riffing.

Oh and I also received my reamp box in the same shipment, so now I can also test around and see how it would work for some live playing. Kraken would also be the live lead guitarist (or bassist) and vocalist, if we ever do some live shows in the future. I would play rhythm guitar and handle the synths, electronics and such.

Anyways, still continuing with the lyrics.</p> <a href="/news/55-future">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="301" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Small update to the site</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">6 Jan 2008</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">I just finished tweaking some small things on pretty much every page of the site, plus I changed the Releases section completely. The Pictures section was changed too. If you see any strange things, or things which look odd, just refresh the site with Ctrl + F5 so it reloads everything from the server and doesn't use (old) cached files.

Oh and I'm quite sure the next album will be called Deep Beneath. It depends on how the lyrics come together and whether it fits the title. However, the artwork I'm pretty set on. I'm still working on the front cover of the album, but here's the inner booklet and back artwork. Click on the images to open the DeviantArt pages of them, with a full-sized version. There's no text and such yet in the versions I posted, since someone might think the song titles are final. They aren't yet.

Hopefully there will be a lot more downloads to come, too ;) In other news, I'm pretty much done with the next album's song order. Starting soon with the lyrics too.

Update:

The titles aren't finished yet, they're just working titles. Also, the final tracklist will be different, this list is just alphabetical:

&lt;b>Bewildered Beyond Disknowledge &lt;/b>(3:33)
An older demo track remade, somewhat fast and traditional

&lt;b>Biodroid Legions &lt;/b>(4:32)
A fast one with a very heavy and dark chorus

&lt;b>Civil War (Funker Vogt cover)&lt;/b> (5:29)
This will maybe appear on the release, if I feel like it and I get a permission to use it. Compared to the original, this one's more concise and of course much heavier with guitars et al. Some artistic liberties taken too.

&lt;b>Deep Beneath &lt;/b>(6:28)
An ambient piece in Dark Corners of the Earth mood. Darkness and pressure.

&lt;b>Re-Activate&lt;/b> (3:28)
A bit darker song with some nice choirs, somewhat fast.

&lt;b>Retribution&lt;/b> (3:50)
Lots of strange melodies, midtempo with some blackish parts.

&lt;b>Rust&lt;/b> (3:14)
Fast one, quite grindy with a lush C-part

&lt;b>Shadow Shapes&lt;/b> (4:00)
The first song I did for this release, tricksy and melodic

&lt;b>The Six Phases of Unrest&lt;/b> (4:21)
Progressive and twisty, lots of varied parts.

&lt;b>The Undying Storm&lt;/b> (4:28)
Another proggy one with a driving chorus

&lt;b>Voidforms&lt;/b> (4:32)
More prog, this time a bit Arcturus-styled with strange leads and a dark fadeout</p> <a href="/news/51-tracks-for-the-next-release">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="305" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">Vortech in Miasma magazine</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">23 Nov 2007</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">There's an interview/article on Vortech on the newest Miasma magazine (#21). I'm still waiting for mine to arrive so I can't describe what the final article is like. But we talked about the new album, the songwriting side and the equipment used while making Vortech albums. There was discussion about internet releases and such, too.

Currently I have ten songs done and I'm still working on two more. The total length is about 50 minutes, but one song may drop depending on how I can re-do it, as I'm not yet satisfied with it. There may be one cover song, depending if I like the final product and if I get a permission for it. Once I've finished polishing up all the songs, it's time to start recording them.

This time I will do the guitars a little bit different than usual. I'm planning to re-amp them in Relativity's rehearsal space house at some serious volume >:) and I think I'll make it two tracks of Marshall JCM900 SL-X 50W and two tracks of Engl Powerball 100W, both through my Engl Vintage 2x12" cab. Should sound sweet. Leads will probably be done with the Marshall.

Overall the songs will be a lot more varied and progressive-ish than previously. A little slower too, except for two songs (no ballads though, heh). And decidedly more electronics all over.

At the same time, I'll probably start recording all the DI tracks for the songs and see where it goes from there.

I sent Daedolon some clean vocal demo lines and he'll do those at his studio sometime soon. Should provide a nice edge to the track Instigate Hostile Reaction. That's the last one remaining at this point.</p> <a href="/news/39-futuristic">Read more</a></article><article aria-posinset="317" aria-setsize="354"><h2 class="noTopMargin noBottomMargin">The time draws nearer...</h2> <p class="greyText noTopMargin noBottomMargin">11 Aug 2007</p> <p class="renderLinebreaks linebreakLongText">I finished doing the final mixes with vocals and everything for 8 songs today.

It's turning out quite nice, being a good continuation and progression on Conclusion. The songs are a lot more aggressive and faster overall.

A new release has been in the works for a while now, with 11 incomplete songs being currently worked on, hopefully for a release in autumn. Some of the working titles include, in alphabetical order:

"Anthromorph", "Impulse", "Infra Red Seekers", "Lord of Worms", "Memoirs of A.I.", "Ominous Dawn", "Perdition", "Rift Vision", "System Boot Failure", "The Core", "Wasteland Roamers"

While waiting for that, the winds of change tear down the foundations and thus a new site is built on the ground zero of old. I present this new form of information center.</p> <a href="/news/1-ominous-dawn">Read more</a></article><!--]--> <hr> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-end;"><a href="/news/">Back to current news</a></div><!----><!----></main></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
